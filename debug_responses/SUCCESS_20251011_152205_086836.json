    "(numRasEntries, numRobEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The Return Address Stack and Reorder Buffer serve different functions in the processor pipeline and their sizing decisions are independent architectural parameters;"
    },
    "(numRasEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The Return Address Stack for function call prediction and L2 TLB for address translation are independent microarchitectural components with separate sizing considerations;"
    },
    "(numRasEntries, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "A larger Return Address Stack improves function return address prediction accuracy, reducing mispredictions that can lead to instruction cache misses when fetching from incorrect addresses;"
    }
