    "(intIssueWidth, power_logic)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing integer issue width requires more complex instruction scheduling logic, decode units, and execution pipelines, directly increasing the logic power consumption;"
    },
    "(intIssueWidth, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher issue width necessitates more transistors in execution units, register files, and scheduling logic, leading to increased leakage power consumption;"
    },
    "(intIssueWidth, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Wider issue width requires additional execution units, larger register files, and more complex scheduling hardware, directly increasing the total cell area;"
    }
