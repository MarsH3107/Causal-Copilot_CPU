    "(enablePrefetching, numRCQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Prefetching is a cache optimization technique while RCQ entries are part of the memory controller's request handling queue, and these operate at different levels of the memory hierarchy without direct causal influence;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, flush)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Enabling prefetching can increase the likelihood of pipeline flushes when prefetched data turns out to be incorrect or when prefetching interferes with the processor's branch prediction accuracy;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, nICacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Prefetching functionality and the number of instruction cache TLB ways are independent architectural parameters that operate at different levels of the memory hierarchy;"
    }
