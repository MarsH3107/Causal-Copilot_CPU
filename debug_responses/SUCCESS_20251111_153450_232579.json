    "(nDCacheWays, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of data cache ways requires additional hardware structures and interconnects, which directly increases the number of I/O pads needed for power distribution and signal routing;"
    },
    "(nDCacheWays, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher cache associativity requires more complex multiplexing and selection logic that switches more frequently during cache operations, directly increasing dynamic switching power consumption;"
    },
    "(nDCacheWays, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing cache associativity adds hardware complexity to the critical path through additional comparators and selection logic, which can directly increase access latency and overall execution time;"
    }
  }
