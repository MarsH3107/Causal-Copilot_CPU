Line  31 | Starts with '(': True  | (numFetchBufferEntries, nL2TLBEntries): C: Fetch buffer entries and L2 TLB entry count are independent architectural parameters with no direct causal relationship;
Line  32 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  33 | Starts with '(': True  | (numFetchBufferEntries, ICacheMiss): A: Increasing fetch buffer entries can help smooth out instruction fetch patterns and potentially reduce instruction cache miss rates by providing better buffering;
Line  34 | Starts with '(': False |
