RAW RESPONSE:
(nDCacheWays, CPI): A: Increasing the number of data cache ways reduces cache conflicts and miss rates, which decreases memory access latency and directly improves cycles per instruction performance;

(nDCacheWays, nDCacheTLBWays): C: The number of data cache ways and the number of data cache TLB ways are independent architectural parameters that can be configured separately without one directly causing changes in the other;

(nDCacheWays, DCacheMiss): A: Increasing the number of data cache ways reduces cache conflicts by providing more placement options for memory blocks, which directly decreases the data cache miss rate;

(nDCacheWays, nDCacheMSHRs): C: The number of data cache ways and the number of miss status holding registers are independent architectural parameters that serve different functions in the cache hierarchy;

(nDCacheWays, ICacheMiss): C: Data cache associativity and instruction cache miss rates are independent since they operate on different memory hierarchies and do not directly influence each other;

(nDCacheWays, nDCacheWays): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would represent a logical impossibility;

(nDCacheWays, flush): C: The number of data cache ways is a static architectural parameter that does not directly cause pipeline flush events, which are typically triggered by control flow changes or hazards
