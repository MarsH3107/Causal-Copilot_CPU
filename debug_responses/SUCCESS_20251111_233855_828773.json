    "(numRXQEntries, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "RXQ entries are internal memory structures that do not directly affect the power consumption of I/O pads, which handle external signal interfacing;"
    },
    "(numRXQEntries, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of RXQ entries requires more transistors and memory cells that switch states during operation, directly increasing switching power consumption;"
    },
    "(numRXQEntries, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of RXQ entries affects performance metrics like throughput but does not directly determine execution time, which depends on workload and other architectural factors;"
    }
  }
