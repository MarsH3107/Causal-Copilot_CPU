    "(power, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Power leakage is a fundamental component of total power consumption in processors, where leakage power directly contributes to and determines the overall power consumption;"
    },
    "(power, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power consumption and cell area are independent design metrics in processor architecture, where power relates to energy consumption while cell area relates to physical layout space;"
    },
    "(power, power_register)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Register power consumption is a specific component that directly contributes to the total power consumption of a processor;"
    }
