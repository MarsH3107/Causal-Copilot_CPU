    "(numRobEntries, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of ROB entries requires more physical storage cells, directly increasing the cell area needed to implement the larger reorder buffer structure;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, power_register)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More ROB entries mean more register storage elements that consume power for maintaining state, directly increasing register-related power consumption;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "ROB size and L2 TLB entries are independent design parameters that serve different functions in the processor architecture;"
    }
