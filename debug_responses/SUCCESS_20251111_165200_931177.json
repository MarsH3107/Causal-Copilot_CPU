    "(memIssueWidth, intIssueWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory issue width and integer issue width are independent design parameters that can be configured separately without one directly causing changes in the other;"
    },
    "(memIssueWidth, nICacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory issue width affects memory operations while instruction cache TLB ways affect instruction fetch, making them independent architectural parameters;"
    },
    "(memIssueWidth, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory issue width primarily affects execution unit power consumption, while pad power is related to I/O interface design and remains largely independent;"
    }
