    "(BranchPredictor, decodeWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Branch predictor and decode width are independent architectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages without direct causal influence;"
    },
    "(BranchPredictor, numRCQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Branch predictor functionality and the number of request completion queue entries are independent design parameters serving different processor subsystems;"
    },
    "(BranchPredictor, power)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Branch predictor circuits consume power through their prediction logic, lookup tables, and update mechanisms, directly contributing to overall processor power consumption;"
    }
