Line   1 | Starts with '(': False | **THINKING STEPS**
Line   2 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   3 | Starts with '(': False | Step 1: Find knowledge about each pair of nodes. 
Line   4 | Starts with '(': False | - numRCQEntries: Number of entries in the Reorder Queue for Cache operations, a buffer for managing cache coherency operations
Line   5 | Starts with '(': False | - nL2TLBEntries: Number of entries in Level 2 Translation Lookaside Buffer
Line   6 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss: Instruction cache miss events
Line   7 | Starts with '(': False | - nDCacheWays: Number of ways in data cache (cache associativity)

Line  10 | Starts with '(': False | - CPI: Cycles Per Instruction (performance metric)
Line  11 | Starts with '(': False | - nICacheWays: Number of ways in instruction cache
Line  12 | Starts with '(': False | - nDCacheTLBWays: Number of ways in data cache TLB
Line  13 | Starts with '(': False | - nL2TLBWays: Number of ways in L2 TLB
Line  14 | Starts with '(': False | - DCacheMiss: Data cache miss events
Line  15 | Starts with '(': False | - nDCacheMSHRs: Number of Miss Status Holding Registers for data cache
Line  16 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  17 | Starts with '(': False | Step 2-6: Analyzing each relationship based on computer architecture domain knowledge.
Line  18 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  19 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, nL2TLBEntries): C: These are independent architectural parameters where the number of cache coherency queue entries does not directly influence the number of L2 TLB entries, as they serve different functions in the memory hierarchy;
Line  20 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  21 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, ICacheMiss): C: The number of cache coherency queue entries is independent of instruction cache miss rates, as RCQ handles cache coherency operations while instruction cache misses are determined by program behavior and cache configuration;
Line  22 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  23 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, nDCacheWays): C: These are independent design parameters where the number of cache coherency queue entries does not influence the associativity configuration of the data cache;
Line  24 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  25 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, numRCQEntries): D: This appears to be a self-relationship which doesn't make logical sense in causal analysis;
Line  26 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  27 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, flush): C: The number of cache coherency queue entries is a static architectural parameter that does not directly cause pipeline flush events, which are typically triggered by control hazards or exceptions;
Line  28 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  29 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, nICacheTLBWays): C: These are independent architectural design choices where the cache coherency queue size does not influence the associativity of the instruction cache TLB;
Line  30 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  31 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, CPI): C: While RCQ size might indirectly affect performance through cache coherency efficiency, there is no direct causal relationship between the number of RCQ entries and cycles per instruction;
Line  32 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  33 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, nICacheWays): C: The number of cache coherency queue entries and instruction cache associativity are independent design parameters that do not directly influence each other;
Line  34 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  35 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, nDCacheTLBWays): C: These represent independent architectural configurations where cache coherency queue size does not directly determine data cache TLB associativity;
Line  36 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  37 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, nL2TLBWays): C: The cache coherency queue size and L2 TLB associativity are independent design parameters that serve different functions in the memory subsystem;
Line  38 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  39 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, DCacheMiss): C: The number of cache coherency queue entries does not directly cause data cache misses, as cache misses are primarily determined by program memory access patterns and cache configuration;
Line  40 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  41 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRCQEntries, nDCacheMSHRs): C: These are independent architectural parameters where the cache coherency queue size does not directly influence the number of miss status holding registers in the data cache
