RAW RESPONSE:
(numRXQEntries, numRXQEntries): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as it represents the same entity;

(numRXQEntries, CPI): A: The number of receive queue entries in the memory subsystem directly affects memory access latency and throughput, which impacts overall processor performance measured by cycles per instruction;

(numRXQEntries, nICacheWays): C: The number of receive queue entries in the memory controller and the number of instruction cache ways are independent architectural parameters that do not directly influence each other;

(numRXQEntries, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Receive queue entries handle memory requests while data cache TLB ways affect address translation, representing independent components with no direct causal relationship;

(numRXQEntries, nL2TLBWays): C: The memory controller's receive queue configuration and the L2 TLB associativity are separate architectural features that operate independently without direct causal influence;

(numRXQEntries, DCacheMiss): A: The number of receive queue entries affects the memory subsystem's ability to handle outstanding requests, which can influence data cache miss handling and overall miss rates;

(numRXQEntries, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Receive queue entries and data cache miss status holding registers serve different functions in the memory hierarchy and are typically configured independently;

(numRXQEntries, nL2TLBEntries): C: The receive queue size and L2 TLB capacity represent different aspects of the memory subsystem that are configured independently without direct causal relationship;

(numRXQEntries, ICacheMiss): A: The memory subsystem's receive queue capacity can affect how efficiently instruction cache misses are serviced, potentially influencing instruction cache miss rates;

(numRXQEntries, nDCacheWays): C: The number of receive queue entries and data cache associativity are independent architectural parameters that serve different purposes in the memory hierarchy;

(numRXQEntries, numRCQEntries): C: Receive queue entries and request completion queue entries are typically independent parameters in memory controller design, each serving distinct functions;

(numRXQEntries, flush): A: The memory subsystem's receive queue capacity can affect pipeline flush frequency by influencing memory access latency and the likelihood of memory-related pipeline stalls;

(numRXQEntries, nICacheTLBWays): C: The receive queue configuration and instruction cache TLB associativity are independent architectural features that do not directly influence each other
