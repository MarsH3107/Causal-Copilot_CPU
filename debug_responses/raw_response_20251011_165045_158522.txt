RAW RESPONSE:
(fetchWidth, nL2TLBEntries): C: Fetch width determines how many instructions are fetched per cycle while L2 TLB entries are a fixed hardware resource for address translation, with no direct causal relationship between instruction fetch bandwidth and TLB capacity;

(fetchWidth, ICacheMiss): A: Higher fetch width increases the demand for instruction cache bandwidth and can lead to more cache misses when the cache cannot supply the required number of instructions per cycle;

(fetchWidth, numLdqEntries): C: Fetch width affects instruction throughput in the front-end while load queue entries are a back-end resource for memory operations, with no direct causal relationship between these pipeline stages;

(fetchWidth, nDCacheWays): C: Fetch width is a front-end parameter controlling instruction fetch rate while data cache associativity is a fixed hardware design parameter for data access, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, decodeWidth): A: Fetch width directly determines the maximum number of instructions available for decoding, as you cannot decode more instructions than you fetch;

(fetchWidth, numRCQEntries): C: Fetch width affects front-end instruction throughput while RCQ entries are specialized back-end resources for cache coherency operations, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, flush): A: Higher fetch width can increase the penalty of pipeline flushes by wasting more fetched instructions when mispredictions or exceptions occur;

(fetchWidth, intIssueWidth): C: Fetch width affects front-end instruction supply while integer issue width is a back-end execution parameter, though both influence overall performance they don't directly cause each other;

(fetchWidth, nICacheTLBWays): C: Fetch width determines instruction fetch bandwidth while instruction cache TLB associativity is a fixed hardware design parameter for address translation, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, maxBrCount): C: Fetch width affects instruction fetch rate while maximum branch count is a constraint on branch prediction resources, with no direct causal relationship between these independent design parameters;

(fetchWidth, numRXQEntries): C: Fetch width is a front-end parameter while RXQ entries are specialized back-end resources for memory system operations, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, CPI): A: Fetch width directly affects instruction throughput by determining how many instructions enter the pipeline per cycle, which inversely impacts cycles per instruction;

(fetchWidth, memIssueWidth): C: Fetch width affects front-end instruction supply while memory issue width is a back-end execution parameter for memory operations, with no direct causal relationship between these pipeline stages;

(fetchWidth, nICacheWays): C: Fetch width determines instruction fetch bandwidth while instruction cache associativity is a fixed hardware design parameter, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, numRasEntries): C: Fetch width affects instruction fetch rate while RAS entries are a fixed hardware resource for return address prediction, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, enableSFBOpt): C: Fetch width is a hardware parameter determining instruction fetch bandwidth while SFB optimization is a software/compiler feature, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Fetch width affects instruction fetch in the front-end while data cache TLB associativity is a fixed hardware parameter for data address translation, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, numIntPhysRegisters): C: Fetch width affects instruction supply rate while the number of integer physical registers is a fixed hardware resource for register renaming, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, nL2TLBWays): C: Fetch width determines instruction fetch bandwidth while L2 TLB associativity is a fixed hardware design parameter for address translation, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, DCacheMiss): C: Fetch width affects instruction fetch in the front-end while data cache misses occur during data access in the back-end, with no direct causal relationship between these different pipeline stages;

(fetchWidth, numFetchBufferEntries): A: Fetch width determines the rate at which instructions are fetched and therefore directly affects the utilization and requirements of fetch buffer entries;

(fetchWidth, enablePrefetching): C: Fetch width is a hardware parameter for instruction fetch bandwidth while prefetching is a memory optimization technique, with no direct causal relationship;

(fetchWidth, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Fetch width affects instruction fetch rate while data cache MSHRs are hardware resources for handling data cache misses, with no direct causal relationship between front-end and back-end components;

(fetchWidth, numRobEntries): C: Fetch width affects instruction supply rate while ROB entries are a fixed hardware resource for out-of-order execution, though both affect performance they don't directly cause each other;

(fetchWidth, fetchWidth): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular reasoning
