    "(area_cell_count, area_cell_count)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as they represent the same measurement;"
    },
    "(area_cell_count, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of cells in a chip design directly increases the computational complexity and processing time required for design tools and simulation;"
    },
    "(area_cell_count, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More cells in a design require additional interconnect routing and wiring between components, directly increasing the net area needed for connections;"
    }
