    "(numRCQEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of request completion queue entries and the number of L2 TLB entries are independent architectural parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline;"
    },
    "(numRCQEntries, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Request completion queue entries manage memory request completion tracking while instruction cache misses are determined by cache size and access patterns, with no direct causal relationship;"
    },
    "(numRCQEntries, nDCacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of request completion queue entries and the number of data cache ways are independent design parameters that affect different aspects of memory system performance;"
    }
