    "(power_switching, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Switching power and execution time are independent metrics where switching power represents dynamic energy consumption while execution time measures performance, with no direct causal relationship between them;"
    },
    "(power_switching, power_clock)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Switching power and clock power are separate components of total power consumption in digital circuits, representing different power dissipation mechanisms without direct causal influence;"
    },
    "(power_switching, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Larger interconnect area increases wire capacitance which directly increases the switching power required to charge and discharge these capacitive loads during signal transitions;"
    }
