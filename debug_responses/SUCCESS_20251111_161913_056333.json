    "(enablePrefetching, numRCQEntries)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Enabling prefetching increases memory traffic and requires more request completion queue entries to handle the additional outstanding memory requests;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, power)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Prefetching mechanisms consume additional power through increased memory accesses, cache activity, and logic operations;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Prefetching is a software/logic feature that does not directly affect the physical pad power consumption of the chip;"
