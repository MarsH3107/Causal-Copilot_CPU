    "(nDCacheTLBWays, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of data cache TLB ways reduces TLB miss rates by providing more associativity for virtual-to-physical address translation, which decreases memory access latency and improves overall processor performance measured by CPI;"

    "(nDCacheTLBWays, nDCacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would represent a logical impossibility in causal analysis;"

    "(nDCacheTLBWays, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher associativity in the data cache TLB through more ways reduces TLB miss rates, which prevents additional memory accesses required for page table walks that could interfere with data cache performance and potentially reduce data cache miss rates;"
