    "(intIssueWidth, power_logic)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing integer issue width requires more complex instruction scheduling logic, dispatch units, and execution control circuits, directly increasing the power consumption of logic components;"
    },
    "(intIssueWidth, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Wider issue width necessitates more transistors in execution units, register files, and control logic, leading to increased static leakage power consumption;"
    },
    "(intIssueWidth, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher integer issue width requires additional execution units, larger register files, and more complex scheduling hardware, directly increasing the total cell area of the processor;"
    }
