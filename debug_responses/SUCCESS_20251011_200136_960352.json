    "(memIssueWidth, intIssueWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent design parameters that are typically configured separately in processor architecture, with no direct causal relationship between memory and integer issue widths;"
    },
    "(memIssueWidth, nICacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory issue width and instruction cache TLB associativity are independent architectural design parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline;"
    },
    "(memIssueWidth, numRXQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory issue width and the number of receive queue entries are independent design parameters that operate in different parts of the processor architecture;"
    }
