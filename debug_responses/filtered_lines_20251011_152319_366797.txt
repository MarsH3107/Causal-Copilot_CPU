1. (numFetchBufferEntries, numRXQEntries): C: These are independent architectural parameters where fetch buffer entries handle instruction fetching while RXQ entries manage memory request queues, with no direct causal relationship between their sizing decisions;
2. (numFetchBufferEntries, CPI): A: Increasing the number of fetch buffer entries can reduce instruction fetch stalls and improve instruction throughput, thereby potentially reducing cycles per instruction;
3. (numFetchBufferEntries, memIssueWidth): C: Fetch buffer entries and memory issue width are independent architectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages with no direct causal relationship;
4. (numFetchBufferEntries, nICacheWays): C: These are independent cache and buffer design parameters where fetch buffer sizing does not directly influence instruction cache associativity decisions;
5. (numFetchBufferEntries, numRasEntries): C: Fetch buffer entries and return address stack entries are independent architectural components serving different functions in the processor pipeline;
6. (numFetchBufferEntries, enableSFBOpt): C: The number of fetch buffer entries is an architectural sizing parameter while SFB optimization is a feature enablement flag, with no direct causal relationship;
