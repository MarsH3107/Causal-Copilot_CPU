RAW RESPONSE:
(enableSFBOpt, DCacheMiss): A: Store-to-load forwarding optimization reduces the need to access the data cache by forwarding store values directly to subsequent loads, thereby reducing data cache miss rates;

(enableSFBOpt, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Store-to-load forwarding optimization operates at the execution pipeline level and does not directly influence the hardware configuration of data cache Miss Status Holding Registers;

(enableSFBOpt, nL2TLBEntries): C: Store-to-load forwarding is a pipeline optimization technique that does not affect the hardware configuration of L2 Translation Lookaside Buffer entries;

(enableSFBOpt, ICacheMiss): C: Store-to-load forwarding optimization specifically targets data dependencies in the execution pipeline and has no direct impact on instruction cache access patterns or miss rates;

(enableSFBOpt, nDCacheWays): C: Store-to-load forwarding is a dynamic execution optimization that does not modify the static hardware configuration of data cache associativity;

(enableSFBOpt, numRCQEntries): C: Store-to-load forwarding optimization operates within the execution units and does not directly affect the hardware sizing of cache queue structures;

(enableSFBOpt, flush): A: Store-to-load forwarding optimization can reduce pipeline flushes by eliminating false dependencies between stores and loads, allowing for more accurate speculation and fewer misprediction-related flushes;

(enableSFBOpt, nICacheTLBWays): C: Store-to-load forwarding optimization focuses on data path execution and has no direct relationship with instruction cache TLB configuration;

(enableSFBOpt, numRXQEntries): C: Store-to-load forwarding is an execution pipeline optimization that does not directly influence the hardware configuration of cache queue entry counts;

(enableSFBOpt, CPI): A: Store-to-load forwarding optimization reduces pipeline stalls by eliminating unnecessary dependencies between stores and loads, thereby improving instruction throughput and reducing cycles per instruction;

(enableSFBOpt, nICacheWays): C: Store-to-load forwarding optimization targets data dependencies in execution and has no direct impact on instruction cache hardware configuration;

(enableSFBOpt, enableSFBOpt): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would represent a logical impossibility;

(enableSFBOpt, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Store-to-load forwarding optimization operates at the execution level and does not directly affect the hardware configuration of data cache TLB associativity;

(enableSFBOpt, nL2TLBWays): C: Store-to-load forwarding is an execution pipeline optimization that has no direct causal relationship with L2 TLB hardware configuration parameters
