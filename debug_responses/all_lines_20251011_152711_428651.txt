Line   1 | Starts with '(': False | **THINKING STEPS**
Line   2 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   3 | Starts with '(': False | Step 1: Find knowledge about each pair of nodes.
Line   4 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss: These are instruction cache misses and data cache misses respectively in computer architecture. Both are performance metrics related to cache behavior.
Line   5 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss: This is the same variable with itself.
Line   6 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   7 | Starts with '(': False | Step 2: Determine correlation.
Line   8 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss: These could be correlated as they both relate to cache performance, but they measure different types of cache misses.
Line   9 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss: A variable is perfectly correlated with itself.
Line  10 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  11 | Starts with '(': False | Step 3: Determine causation.
Line  12 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss: While both are cache misses, instruction cache misses and data cache misses are fundamentally different events that occur independently based on different access patterns.
Line  13 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss: A variable cannot cause itself in a meaningful causal sense.
Line  14 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  15 | Starts with '(': False | Step 4: Determine if relationship is direct.
Line  16 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss: No direct causal relationship exists between these independent cache miss types.
Line  17 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss: Not applicable as this is the same variable.
Line  18 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  19 | Starts with '(': False | Step 5: Determine direction.
Line  20 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss: No causal direction as they are independent events.
Line  21 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss: Not applicable.
Line  22 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  23 | Starts with '(': False | Step 6: Provide explanation based on domain knowledge.
Line  24 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  25 | Starts with '(': True  | (ICacheMiss, DCacheMiss): C: Instruction cache misses and data cache misses are independent events that occur due to different memory access patterns and do not directly cause each other;
Line  26 | Starts with '(': True  | (ICacheMiss, ICacheMiss): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be a tautological relationship rather than a meaningful causal connection;
