    "(area_cell_count, area_cell_count)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as they represent the same measurement;"
    },
    "(area_cell_count, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of cells in a chip design directly increases the computational complexity and processing time required for synthesis, place-and-route, and simulation tools;"
    },
    "(area_cell_count, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "A higher number of cells in the design necessitates more interconnect wiring and routing resources, directly increasing the net area required for connections between cells;"
    }
  }
