    "(numLdqEntries, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "The number of load queue entries directly affects memory instruction scheduling and pipeline stalls, where more entries reduce memory-related stalls and improve cycles per instruction performance;"
    },
    "(numLdqEntries, nICacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Load queue entries handle memory operations while instruction cache ways affect instruction fetch, representing independent architectural components with no direct causal relationship;"
    },
    "(numLdqEntries, enableSFBOpt)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Load queue sizing is a hardware resource allocation decision while store-to-load forwarding optimization is a microarchitectural technique, representing independent design choices;"
    }
