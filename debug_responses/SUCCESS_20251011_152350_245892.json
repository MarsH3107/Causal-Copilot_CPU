    "(numRobEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of reorder buffer entries and L2 TLB entries are independent architectural parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline and do not directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "A larger reorder buffer allows more instructions to be in flight simultaneously, which can help hide instruction cache miss latencies by continuing execution of other instructions while cache misses are resolved;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, numLdqEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Both are independent buffer sizing parameters in the processor design where the reorder buffer handles instruction completion order while the load queue manages memory load operations;"
    }
