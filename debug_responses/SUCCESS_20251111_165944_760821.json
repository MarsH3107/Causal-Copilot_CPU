    "(nDCacheMSHRs, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of data cache MSHRs requires additional hardware structures and logic, which directly increases the physical cell area needed for implementation;"

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular and logically inconsistent;"

      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More data cache MSHRs require additional register structures to track outstanding misses, which increases register file power consumption;"
