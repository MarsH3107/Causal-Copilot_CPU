    "(area, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Larger chip area typically requires more I/O pads for connectivity, directly increasing pad-related power consumption;"
    },
    "(area, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Larger chip area generally contains more transistors and logic gates, leading to increased switching activity and higher dynamic power consumption;"
    },
    "(area, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Chip area and execution time are independent design metrics, as timing is determined by critical path delays rather than total area;"
    }
  }
