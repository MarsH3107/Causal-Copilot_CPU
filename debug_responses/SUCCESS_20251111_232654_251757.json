    "(numRasEntries, numRobEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "RAS entries for branch prediction and ROB entries for instruction retirement are independent microarchitectural resources that don't directly influence each other's sizing;"
    },
    "(numRasEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Return address stack entries and L2 TLB entries serve completely different functions in the processor and are sized independently;"
    },
    "(numRasEntries, area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing RAS entries requires additional storage hardware which directly increases the total chip area;"
    }
  }
