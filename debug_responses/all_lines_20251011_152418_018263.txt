Line   1 | Starts with '(': False | **THINKING STEPS**
Line   2 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   3 | Starts with '(': False | Step 1: Find knowledge about each pair of nodes. These are all computer architecture parameters related to CPU design and performance metrics.
Line   4 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   5 | Starts with '(': False | Step 2-6: I'll analyze each pair systematically based on computer architecture domain knowledge.
Line   6 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   7 | Starts with '(': False | **Response:**
Line   8 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   9 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, DCacheMiss): A: Integer issue width determines how many integer instructions can be issued per cycle, and higher issue widths can generate more memory requests that may exceed cache capacity, leading to increased data cache misses;
Line  10 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  11 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, enablePrefetching): C: Integer issue width is a hardware execution parameter while prefetching enablement is a separate cache optimization feature that operates independently of instruction issue capabilities;
Line  12 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  13 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Integer issue width affects instruction throughput while the number of data cache Miss Status Holding Registers is a fixed hardware resource allocation that doesn't change based on issue width;
Line  14 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  15 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, nL2TLBEntries): C: Integer issue width controls instruction dispatch rate while L2 TLB entries represent a fixed hardware resource for address translation that operates independently;
Line  16 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  17 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, ICacheMiss): A: Higher integer issue width increases instruction fetch demand per cycle, which can exceed instruction cache capacity and lead to more instruction cache misses;
Line  18 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  19 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, numLdqEntries): C: Integer issue width determines instruction dispatch capability while load queue entries represent a fixed hardware buffer size that doesn't change based on issue width;
Line  20 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  21 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, nDCacheWays): C: Integer issue width affects instruction throughput while data cache associativity is a fixed architectural parameter that operates independently of issue capabilities;
Line  22 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  23 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, numRCQEntries): C: Integer issue width controls instruction dispatch while the number of request completion queue entries is a fixed hardware resource that doesn't vary with issue width;
Line  24 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  25 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, intIssueWidth): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular and logically invalid;
Line  26 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  27 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, flush): A: Higher integer issue width can lead to more speculative execution and deeper pipelines, increasing the likelihood and cost of pipeline flushes when mispredictions occur;
Line  28 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  29 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, nICacheTLBWays): C: Integer issue width affects instruction dispatch rate while instruction cache TLB associativity is a fixed hardware parameter that operates independently;
Line  30 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  31 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, numRXQEntries): C: Integer issue width determines instruction throughput while the number of request transmit queue entries is a fixed hardware resource allocation;
Line  32 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  33 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, CPI): A: Integer issue width directly affects instruction-level parallelism and execution efficiency, with higher issue widths typically reducing cycles per instruction through better utilization;
Line  34 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  35 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, nICacheWays): C: Integer issue width controls instruction dispatch capability while instruction cache associativity is a fixed architectural design parameter;
Line  36 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  37 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, enableSFBOpt): C: Integer issue width affects instruction execution while store-to-load forwarding optimization is an independent feature that operates regardless of issue width;
Line  38 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  39 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Integer issue width determines instruction throughput while data cache TLB associativity is a fixed hardware parameter that doesn't change with issue capabilities;
Line  40 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  41 | Starts with '(': True  | (intIssueWidth, nL2TLBWays): C: Integer issue width affects instruction dispatch while L2 TLB associativity is a fixed hardware design parameter that operates independently of issue width
