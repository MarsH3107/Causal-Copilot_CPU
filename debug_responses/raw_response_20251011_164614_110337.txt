RAW RESPONSE:
(memIssueWidth, intIssueWidth): C: Memory issue width and integer issue width are independent processor design parameters that control different execution units and do not directly influence each other;

(memIssueWidth, nICacheTLBWays): C: Memory issue width affects memory operation throughput while instruction cache TLB ways determine address translation capacity, representing independent architectural parameters;

(memIssueWidth, numRXQEntries): C: Memory issue width controls memory operation dispatch rate while RXQ entries manage network packet reception, representing independent system components;

(memIssueWidth, CPI): A: Memory issue width directly affects the processor's ability to dispatch memory operations per cycle, which influences overall instruction execution rate and cycles per instruction;

(memIssueWidth, memIssueWidth): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself;

(memIssueWidth, nICacheWays): C: Memory issue width affects memory operation dispatch while instruction cache ways determine cache associativity, representing independent processor design parameters;

(memIssueWidth, enableSFBOpt): C: Memory issue width is a hardware parameter controlling dispatch rate while store-to-load forwarding optimization is a separate microarchitectural feature;

(memIssueWidth, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Memory issue width controls operation dispatch rate while data cache TLB ways determine address translation associativity, representing independent design choices;

(memIssueWidth, nL2TLBWays): C: Memory issue width affects memory operation throughput while L2 TLB ways control address translation cache associativity, representing independent architectural parameters;

(memIssueWidth, enablePrefetching): C: Memory issue width controls dispatch bandwidth while prefetching is an independent optimization technique for predicting future memory accesses;

(memIssueWidth, DCacheMiss): A: Memory issue width affects the rate at which memory operations are dispatched, which can influence data cache access patterns and miss rates;

(memIssueWidth, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Memory issue width controls dispatch rate while MSHRs manage outstanding cache misses, representing independent but complementary processor components;

(memIssueWidth, nL2TLBEntries): C: Memory issue width affects operation dispatch while L2 TLB entries determine address translation cache capacity, representing independent design parameters;

(memIssueWidth, ICacheMiss): C: Memory issue width primarily affects memory operations while instruction cache misses relate to instruction fetch, representing different processor pipeline stages;

(memIssueWidth, numLdqEntries): C: Memory issue width controls dispatch bandwidth while load queue entries manage pending load operations, representing independent but related processor resources;

(memIssueWidth, nDCacheWays): C: Memory issue width affects operation dispatch rate while data cache ways determine cache associativity, representing independent architectural design choices;

(memIssueWidth, numRCQEntries): C: Memory issue width controls memory operation dispatch while RCQ entries manage network packet reception, representing independent system components;

(memIssueWidth, flush): A: Memory issue width affects the number of memory operations in flight, which can influence the cost and frequency of pipeline flushes when exceptions or mispredictions occur
