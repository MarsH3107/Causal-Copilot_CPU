    "(power_internal, power_logic)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Power logic consumption directly contributes to the overall internal power consumption of a processor, as logic circuits are a fundamental component of internal power dissipation;"
    },
    "(power_internal, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "The physical area occupied by cells directly influences internal power consumption through increased capacitance and switching activity in larger circuit areas;"
    },
    "(power_internal, power_register)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Register file power consumption is a direct component of internal power consumption, as registers are essential internal storage elements that contribute to overall power dissipation;"
    }
