    "(nICacheTLBWays, power_internal)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of TLB ways requires more hardware structures and logic circuits, which directly increases internal power consumption due to additional transistors and switching activity;"
    },
    "(nICacheTLBWays, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More TLB ways require additional routing and interconnect structures to connect the extra hardware components, directly increasing the net area occupied by wiring;"
    },
    "(nICacheTLBWays, nDCacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of instruction cache TLB ways and data cache TLB ways are independent design parameters that can be configured separately without direct causal relationship;"
