    "(area_cell_area, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as it represents the same physical measurement;"
    },
    "(area_cell_area, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Cell area is a static physical design parameter that does not directly influence execution or simulation time;"
    },
    "(area_cell_area, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Both represent independent area components in chip design where cell area and net routing area are determined by different design constraints and do not directly cause each other;"
    }
