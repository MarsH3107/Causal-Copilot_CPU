    "(nDCacheMSHRs, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of MSHRs requires additional hardware structures, which directly increases the physical cell area needed for implementation;"

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A node cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular and logically invalid;"

      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More MSHRs require additional register structures to store miss information, directly increasing register power consumption;"
