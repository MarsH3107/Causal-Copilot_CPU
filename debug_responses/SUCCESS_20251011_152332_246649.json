    "(nICacheWays, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of ways in the instruction cache associativity is independent of data cache miss rates since instruction cache configuration does not directly affect data memory access patterns;"
    },
    "(nICacheWays, nDCacheMSHRs)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Instruction cache associativity configuration is independent of data cache Miss Status Holding Registers since these are separate cache subsystems with distinct purposes;"
    },
    "(nICacheWays, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of ways in instruction cache associativity directly reduces instruction cache miss rates by providing more storage locations for instruction blocks and reducing cache conflicts;"
