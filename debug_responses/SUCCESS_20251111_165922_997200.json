    "(power_clock, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Clock power and cell area are both outcomes of design decisions but do not directly cause each other in processor architecture;"
    },
    "(power_clock, area_cell_count)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Clock power consumption and the number of standard cells are independent design metrics that do not directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(power_clock, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Clock power and pad power represent separate power consumption components in processor design with no direct causal relationship;"
    }
