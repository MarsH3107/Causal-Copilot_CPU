Line   1 | Starts with '(': False | **THINKING STEPS**
Line   2 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   3 | Starts with '(': False | Step 1: Find knowledge about each pair of nodes.
Line   4 | Starts with '(': False | - CPI (Cycles Per Instruction): A performance metric measuring how many clock cycles are needed to execute one instruction on average
Line   5 | Starts with '(': False | - flush: Pipeline flush events that occur when the processor needs to discard instructions in the pipeline (due to branch mispredictions, exceptions, etc.)
Line   6 | Starts with '(': False | - DCacheMiss: Data cache miss events when requested data is not found in the data cache
Line   7 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss: Instruction cache miss events when requested instructions are not found in the instruction cache
Line   8 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   9 | Starts with '(': False | Step 2: Determine correlations based on domain knowledge.
Line  10 | Starts with '(': False | All pairs are correlated in processor architecture - cache misses and flushes directly impact CPI.
Line  11 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  12 | Starts with '(': False | Step 3: Determine causation.
Line  13 | Starts with '(': False | - flush → CPI: Pipeline flushes cause increased CPI
Line  14 | Starts with '(': False | - DCacheMiss → CPI: Data cache misses cause increased CPI  
Line  15 | Starts with '(': False | - ICacheMiss → CPI: Instruction cache misses cause increased CPI
Line  16 | Starts with '(': False | - CPI → CPI: This is the same variable, no causation
Line  17 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  18 | Starts with '(': False | Step 4: Determine if relationships are direct.
Line  19 | Starts with '(': False | Yes, these are direct causal relationships in processor performance.
Line  20 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  21 | Starts with '(': False | Step 5: Determine direction.
Line  22 | Starts with '(': False | - CPI and flush: flush causes CPI increase (B)
Line  23 | Starts with '(': False | - CPI and CPI: Same variable (C)
Line  24 | Starts with '(': False | - CPI and DCacheMiss: DCacheMiss causes CPI increase (B)
Line  25 | Starts with '(': False | - CPI and ICacheMiss: ICacheMiss causes CPI increase (B)
Line  26 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  27 | Starts with '(': False | Step 6: Provide explanations based on processor architecture domain knowledge.
Line  28 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  29 | Starts with '(': True  | (CPI, flush): B: Pipeline flush events directly increase the cycles per instruction because flushed instructions must be re-fetched and re-executed, adding extra cycles without completing useful work;
Line  30 | Starts with '(': True  | (CPI, CPI): C: This represents the same variable with itself, so there is no meaningful causal relationship to analyze;
Line  31 | Starts with '(': True  | (CPI, DCacheMiss): B: Data cache misses cause the processor to stall while waiting for data from slower memory levels, directly increasing the number of cycles required per instruction;
Line  32 | Starts with '(': True  | (CPI, ICacheMiss): B: Instruction cache misses force the processor to fetch instructions from slower memory levels, creating pipeline stalls that increase the cycles needed per instruction;
