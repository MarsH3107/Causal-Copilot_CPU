RAW RESPONSE:
(decodeWidth, CPI): A: Decode width directly affects instruction throughput by determining how many instructions can be decoded per cycle, with wider decode stages reducing CPI by enabling higher instruction-level parallelism;

(decodeWidth, memIssueWidth): C: Decode width and memory issue width are independent pipeline parameters that operate at different stages, with decode width affecting instruction decoding while memory issue width affects memory operation dispatch;

(decodeWidth, nICacheWays): C: Decode width is a pipeline parameter that affects instruction processing rate while instruction cache associativity is a memory hierarchy design choice that operates independently;

(decodeWidth, enableSFBOpt): C: Decode width affects instruction decoding capacity while store-to-load forwarding optimization is a memory subsystem feature that operates independently of decode stage width;

(decodeWidth, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Decode width affects instruction processing throughput while data cache TLB associativity is a memory management unit design parameter that operates independently;

(decodeWidth, numIntPhysRegisters): C: Decode width determines instruction decoding capacity while the number of integer physical registers is a register file sizing decision that operates independently of decode stage width;

(decodeWidth, nL2TLBWays): C: Decode width affects instruction pipeline throughput while L2 TLB associativity is a memory management design parameter that operates independently of instruction decoding;

(decodeWidth, DCacheMiss): A: Decode width can indirectly influence data cache miss rates by affecting the rate at which memory-accessing instructions are processed and enter the pipeline;

(decodeWidth, enablePrefetching): C: Decode width affects instruction processing rate while prefetching is a memory subsystem optimization technique that operates independently of decode stage configuration;

(decodeWidth, numRobEntries): C: Decode width affects instruction decoding rate while reorder buffer size is a separate microarchitectural parameter that determines instruction window size independently;

(decodeWidth, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Decode width affects instruction processing throughput while data cache MSHR count is a memory subsystem parameter that operates independently of decode stage width;

(decodeWidth, nL2TLBEntries): C: Decode width determines instruction decoding capacity while L2 TLB entry count is a memory management parameter that operates independently of instruction pipeline width;

(decodeWidth, ICacheMiss): A: Decode width can influence instruction cache miss rates by affecting the rate at which instructions are fetched and consumed from the instruction cache;

(decodeWidth, numLdqEntries): C: Decode width affects instruction decoding rate while load queue size is a memory subsystem parameter that operates independently of decode stage configuration;

(decodeWidth, nDCacheWays): C: Decode width affects instruction processing throughput while data cache associativity is a memory hierarchy design choice that operates independently;

(decodeWidth, decodeWidth): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would represent a logical impossibility;

(decodeWidth, numRCQEntries): C: Decode width affects instruction decoding capacity while request completion queue size is a memory subsystem parameter that operates independently;

(decodeWidth, flush): A: Decode width can influence pipeline flush frequency by affecting instruction throughput and the rate at which mispredicted branches are processed;

(decodeWidth, intIssueWidth): C: Decode width and integer issue width are independent pipeline parameters that operate at different stages, with decode affecting instruction parsing while issue affects execution unit dispatch;

(decodeWidth, nICacheTLBWays): C: Decode width affects instruction processing rate while instruction cache TLB associativity is a memory management design parameter that operates independently;

(decodeWidth, numRXQEntries): C: Decode width affects instruction decoding throughput while request crossbar queue size is a memory subsystem parameter that operates independently of decode stage width
