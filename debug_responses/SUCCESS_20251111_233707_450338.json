    "(nDCacheTLBWays, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of TLB ways requires additional hardware structures and interconnects that directly increase pad power consumption for driving signals off-chip;"
    },
    "(nDCacheTLBWays, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More TLB ways require additional comparators and multiplexers that switch more frequently during address translation, directly increasing switching power consumption;"
    },
    "(nDCacheTLBWays, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher TLB associativity can reduce TLB miss rates and improve memory access latency, potentially reducing overall execution time;"
    }
