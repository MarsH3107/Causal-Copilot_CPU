    "(area, power_pad)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "I/O pad requirements are determined by external interface needs, and their area contributes to total chip area;"
    },
    "(area, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Larger chip area typically contains more transistors that switch, directly increasing dynamic switching power consumption;"
    },
    "(area, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Chip area and execution time are independent as timing depends on critical path delay and clock frequency, not physical size;"
    }
