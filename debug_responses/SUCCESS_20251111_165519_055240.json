    "(numRobEntries, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing ROB entries requires more storage cells and associated logic, directly increasing the physical cell area needed for implementation;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, power_register)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More ROB entries mean more register storage elements that consume power through switching activity and leakage, directly increasing register power consumption;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "ROB size and L2 TLB entries are independent design parameters that serve different functions in the processor architecture;"
    }
