      "explanation": "The number of receive queue entries in the memory subsystem directly affects memory access latency and throughput, which impacts overall processor performance measured by cycles per instruction;"

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of receive queue entries in the memory controller and the number of instruction cache ways are independent architectural parameters that do not directly influence each other;"
