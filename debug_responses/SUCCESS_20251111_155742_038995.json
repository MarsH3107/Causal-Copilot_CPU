    "(cpi, power_memory)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "CPI and memory power consumption are both outcomes of architectural design choices but CPI does not directly cause changes in memory power consumption;"
    },
    "(cpi, power)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "CPI is a performance metric while total power consumption is a physical characteristic, both determined by underlying architectural parameters rather than one causing the other;"
    },
    "(cpi, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "CPI performance metric does not directly influence pad power consumption, as both are independent outcomes of processor design decisions;"
    }
