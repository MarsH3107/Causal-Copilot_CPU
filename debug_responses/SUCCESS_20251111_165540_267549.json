    "(nDCacheTLBWays, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of TLB ways requires additional hardware structures and transistors, which directly increases the power consumption of pad circuits needed for signal routing and I/O operations;"
    },
    "(nDCacheTLBWays, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More TLB ways increase the number of transistors and switching circuits in the cache subsystem, directly leading to higher dynamic power consumption during cache operations;"
    },
    "(nDCacheTLBWays, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing TLB associativity can reduce TLB miss rates and improve cache performance, potentially reducing overall execution time for memory-intensive workloads;"
    }
