    "(numRobEntries, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of ROB entries requires more physical storage cells in the processor, directly increasing the total cell area needed for implementation;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, power_register)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More ROB entries mean more register storage elements that consume power for maintaining state, directly increasing register power consumption;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of ROB entries and L2 TLB entries are independent design parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline;"
    }
