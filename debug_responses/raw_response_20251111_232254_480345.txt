RAW RESPONSE:
Looking at the relationships involving nL2TLBEntries (number of L2 Translation Lookaside Buffer entries) in computer architecture:

(nL2TLBEntries, nDCacheTLBWays): C: These are independent cache configuration parameters that can be set independently without one directly causing changes in the other;

(nL2TLBEntries, power_logic): A: Increasing the number of L2 TLB entries requires additional logic circuits and transistors, which directly increases the power consumption of logic components;

(nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBWays): C: The number of entries and associativity (ways) are independent design parameters that can be configured separately in TLB design;

(nL2TLBEntries, power_leakage): A: More TLB entries mean more transistors and storage cells, which directly increases static power leakage in the processor;

(nL2TLBEntries, area_cell_area): A: Additional TLB entries require more memory cells and associated circuitry, directly increasing the total cell area on the chip;

(nL2TLBEntries, nDCacheMSHRs): C: TLB entries and data cache miss status holding registers are independent architectural components with separate design considerations;

(nL2TLBEntries, power_register): A: More TLB entries require additional register storage elements, which directly increases power consumption in the register file components;

(nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBEntries): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself;

(nL2TLBEntries, area): A: Increasing the number of L2 TLB entries requires additional silicon area for the storage cells and associated logic, directly increasing total chip area;

(nL2TLBEntries, area_cell_count): A: More TLB entries directly translate to a higher number of memory cells needed to implement the TLB structure;

(nL2TLBEntries, nDCacheWays): C: L2 TLB entries and data cache associativity are independent cache design parameters that can be configured separately;

(nL2TLBEntries, power_memory): A: Additional TLB entries increase the memory storage requirements and associated access circuitry, directly increasing memory-related power consumption;

(nL2TLBEntries, power): A: More TLB entries require additional transistors and storage elements, which directly increases the overall power consumption of the processor;

(nL2TLBEntries, power_pad): C: TLB entries are internal processor components that do not directly affect the I/O pad power consumption;

(nL2TLBEntries, nICacheTLBWays): C: L2 TLB entries and instruction cache TLB associativity are independent cache configuration parameters;

(nL2TLBEntries, power_switching): A: More TLB entries mean more transistors that can switch states during operation, directly increasing dynamic switching power;

(nL2TLBEntries, time): C: The number of TLB entries is a static design parameter that does not directly cause changes in execution time;

(nL2TLBEntries, cpi): A: More L2 TLB entries can reduce TLB miss rates and memory access penalties, potentially improving cycles per instruction performance;

(nL2TLBEntries, power_clock): A: Additional TLB entries require more clock distribution to drive the extra storage and logic elements, increasing clock power consumption;

(nL2TLBEntries, nICacheWays): C: L2 TLB entries and instruction cache associativity are independent architectural parameters with separate design considerations;

(nL2TLBEntries, power_internal): A: More TLB entries increase the internal logic and storage requirements, directly contributing to higher internal power consumption;

(nL2TLBEntries, area_net_area): A: Additional TLB entries require more interconnect wiring between cells and logic blocks, increasing the net area on the chip;
