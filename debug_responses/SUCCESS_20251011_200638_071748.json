    "(flush, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Data cache misses can trigger pipeline flushes in certain processor architectures when the miss handling requires clearing speculative execution state;"
    },
    "(flush, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Instruction cache misses typically cause pipeline flushes because the processor cannot continue fetching instructions and must restart the pipeline once the missing instructions are retrieved;"
    },
    "(flush, flush)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "This represents the same variable with itself, so there is no meaningful causal relationship to analyze;"
