    "(nDCacheWays, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of data cache ways reduces cache conflicts and miss rates, which directly improves memory access performance and reduces the average cycles per instruction;"
    },
    "(nDCacheWays, nDCacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of data cache ways and the number of data cache TLB ways are independent design parameters that can be configured separately without one directly causing changes in the other;"
    },
    "(nDCacheWays, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher associativity in the data cache (more ways) reduces cache conflicts and collision misses, directly leading to fewer data cache miss events;"
    }
