    "(intIssueWidth, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Integer issue width determines how many integer instructions can be dispatched per cycle, and higher issue widths generate more memory access requests that can lead to increased data cache misses;"
    },
    "(intIssueWidth, enablePrefetching)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Integer issue width is a hardware dispatch parameter while prefetching is a memory optimization technique - they operate independently in different processor subsystems;"
    },
    "(intIssueWidth, nDCacheMSHRs)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Issue width affects instruction dispatch rate while MSHR count is a cache design parameter for handling outstanding misses - no direct causal relationship exists;"
    }
