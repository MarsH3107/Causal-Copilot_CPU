    "(power_internal, power_logic)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power_internal and power_logic are separate components of total power consumption that are independently calculated based on different circuit activities and design parameters;"
    },
    "(power_internal, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power_internal is determined by switching activity and voltage levels while area_cell_area is a physical layout metric, making them independent measures of different design aspects;"
    },
    "(power_internal, power_register)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power_internal and power_register represent distinct power consumption categories that are calculated separately based on different circuit components and activities;"
    }
