    "(BranchPredictor, decodeWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Branch predictor accuracy and decode width are independent architectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages and do not directly influence each other's configuration;"
    },
    "(BranchPredictor, numRCQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Branch predictor mechanisms and the number of request completion queue entries are independent design parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline;"
    },
    "(BranchPredictor, flush)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Branch mispredictions directly cause pipeline flushes as the processor must discard incorrectly fetched and decoded instructions when the actual branch outcome differs from the prediction;"
    }
  }
