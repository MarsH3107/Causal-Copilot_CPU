    "(numRobEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The reorder buffer size and L2 TLB entries are independent architectural parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline without direct causal influence;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "A larger reorder buffer allows more instructions to be in flight simultaneously, potentially increasing instruction fetch pressure and leading to more instruction cache misses;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, numLdqEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Both are independent sizing parameters for different processor structures that are typically configured based on design requirements rather than one causing the other;"
    }
