    "(numRCQEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent hardware configuration parameters where the number of reorder queue entries for cache operations does not directly influence the number of L2 TLB entries;"
    },
    "(numRCQEntries, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of reorder queue entries is a structural parameter that does not directly cause instruction cache misses, which are determined by program behavior and cache size/associativity;"
    },
    "(numRCQEntries, nDCacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These represent independent hardware design parameters where the reorder queue size does not influence the associativity configuration of the data cache;"
