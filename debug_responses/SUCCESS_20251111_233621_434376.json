    "(cpi, power_memory)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "CPI and memory power consumption are both outcomes of underlying architectural design decisions and workload characteristics, but CPI does not directly cause changes in memory power consumption;"
    },
    "(cpi, power)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "CPI and total power consumption are both results of processor architecture and workload characteristics, but CPI itself does not directly cause overall power consumption changes;"
    },
    "(cpi, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "CPI and pad power consumption are independent metrics where CPI reflects instruction execution efficiency while pad power relates to I/O interface power consumption;"
    }
