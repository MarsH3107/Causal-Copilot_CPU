    "(nDCacheTLBWays, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of TLB ways requires additional hardware structures and interconnects, which directly increases pad power consumption for driving signals to external components;"
    },
    "(nDCacheTLBWays, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More TLB ways require additional comparators and selection logic that switch more frequently during address translation, directly increasing switching power consumption;"
    },
    "(nDCacheTLBWays, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher TLB associativity reduces TLB miss rates by providing more storage locations for address translations, which can decrease memory access latency and overall execution time;"
    }
