    "(nL2TLBEntries, nDCacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent cache configuration parameters that can be set independently without one directly causing changes in the other;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBEntries, power_logic)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of L2 TLB entries requires additional logic circuits and transistors, which directly increases the power consumption of logic components;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of entries and associativity (ways) are independent design parameters that can be configured separately in TLB design;"
