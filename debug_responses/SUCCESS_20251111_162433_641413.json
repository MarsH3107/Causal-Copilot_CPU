    "(decodeWidth, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing decode width requires more transistors and logic gates to operate simultaneously, directly increasing switching activity and power consumption;"
    },
    "(decodeWidth, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Decode width is a design parameter that affects performance but does not directly determine execution time, which depends on workload and other factors;"
    },
    "(decodeWidth, cpi)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Wider decode width allows more instructions to be decoded per cycle, potentially reducing cycles per instruction by improving instruction-level parallelism;"
    }
  }
