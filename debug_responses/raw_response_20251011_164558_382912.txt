RAW RESPONSE:
(numIntPhysRegisters, nICacheWays): C: The number of integer physical registers in the processor core and the associativity of the instruction cache are independent architectural parameters that operate in different subsystems without direct causal influence;

(numIntPhysRegisters, enableSFBOpt): C: Integer physical registers handle register renaming for execution units while store-to-load forwarding optimization is a memory subsystem feature, making these parameters architecturally independent;

(numIntPhysRegisters, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Integer physical registers are part of the execution core's register file while data cache TLB associativity is a memory management unit parameter, operating independently in different processor subsystems;

(numIntPhysRegisters, numIntPhysRegisters): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would represent a logical impossibility;

(numIntPhysRegisters, nL2TLBWays): C: Integer physical registers manage instruction execution dependencies while L2 TLB associativity handles virtual-to-physical address translation, representing independent architectural components;

(numIntPhysRegisters, enablePrefetching): C: Register renaming capacity and memory prefetching mechanisms operate in separate processor subsystems without direct causal dependencies;

(numIntPhysRegisters, DCacheMiss): C: While both affect overall performance, the number of integer registers primarily influences instruction-level parallelism while data cache misses depend on memory access patterns and cache design parameters;

(numIntPhysRegisters, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Integer physical registers handle register dependencies in the execution pipeline while data cache MSHRs manage outstanding memory requests, operating as independent architectural resources;

(numIntPhysRegisters, nL2TLBEntries): C: Register file size for integer operations and L2 TLB capacity for address translation represent independent processor subsystems with no direct causal relationship;

(numIntPhysRegisters, ICacheMiss): C: Integer register availability affects execution unit utilization while instruction cache misses depend on instruction fetch patterns and cache parameters, making them architecturally independent;

(numIntPhysRegisters, numLdqEntries): C: Integer physical registers manage register renaming while load queue entries handle memory operation ordering, representing independent processor resources;

(numIntPhysRegisters, nDCacheWays): C: Register file capacity and data cache associativity are independent architectural parameters that affect different aspects of processor performance without direct causal influence;

(numIntPhysRegisters, numRCQEntries): C: Integer physical registers handle execution dependencies while recycle queue entries manage instruction retirement, operating as independent processor subsystems;

(numIntPhysRegisters, flush): C: Pipeline flushes are typically caused by branch mispredictions or exceptions rather than register file capacity, making these parameters independent;

(numIntPhysRegisters, intIssueWidth): A: The number of integer physical registers directly constrains the maximum integer issue width since insufficient registers would create bottlenecks for out-of-order execution and instruction-level parallelism;

(numIntPhysRegisters, nICacheTLBWays): C: Integer register file capacity and instruction cache TLB associativity operate in different processor subsystems without direct causal dependencies;

(numIntPhysRegisters, numRXQEntries): C: Integer physical registers manage execution dependencies while RXQ entries handle specific queue operations, representing independent architectural resources;

(numIntPhysRegisters, CPI): A: The number of integer physical registers directly affects cycles per instruction by influencing register renaming efficiency and instruction-level parallelism capabilities;

(numIntPhysRegisters, memIssueWidth): C: Integer physical registers primarily affect integer execution while memory issue width depends on memory subsystem design, making them largely independent parameters;
