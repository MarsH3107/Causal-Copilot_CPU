    "(enableSFBOpt, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Store-to-load forwarding optimization reduces the need to access the data cache by forwarding store values directly to subsequent loads, thereby reducing data cache miss rates;"
    },
    "(enableSFBOpt, nDCacheMSHRs)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Store-to-load forwarding optimization operates at the execution pipeline level and does not directly influence the hardware configuration of data cache Miss Status Holding Registers;"

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Store-to-load forwarding is a pipeline optimization technique that does not affect the hardware configuration of L2 Translation Lookaside Buffer entries;"
