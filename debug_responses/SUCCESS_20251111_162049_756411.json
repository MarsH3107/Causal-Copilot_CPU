    "(numRasEntries, numRobEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "RAS entries for return address prediction and ROB entries for instruction reordering are independent microarchitectural parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline;"
    },
    "(numRasEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Return address stack size and L2 TLB entries are independent parameters serving different functions - branch prediction versus memory address translation;"
    },
    "(numRasEntries, area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing RAS entries requires additional storage hardware which directly increases the total chip area;"
    }
