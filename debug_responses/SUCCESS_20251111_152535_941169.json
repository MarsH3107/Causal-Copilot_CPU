    "(BranchPredictor, decodeWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Branch predictor and decode width are independent architectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages and do not directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(BranchPredictor, numRCQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Branch predictor functionality and the number of reorder completion queue entries are independent design parameters that serve different purposes in the processor pipeline;"
    },
    "(BranchPredictor, power)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Branch predictor complexity and accuracy directly affect power consumption through increased transistor count, switching activity, and prediction table accesses;"
    }
