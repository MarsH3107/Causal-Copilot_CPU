    "(CPI, flush)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Pipeline flush events directly increase the cycles per instruction because they force the processor to discard partially executed instructions and restart the pipeline, adding extra cycles without completing useful work;"
    },
    "(CPI, CPI)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "This represents the same variable with itself, so there is no meaningful causal relationship to analyze;"
    },
    "(CPI, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Data cache misses cause the processor to stall while waiting for data to be fetched from slower memory levels, directly increasing the number of cycles required per instruction;"
    }
  }
