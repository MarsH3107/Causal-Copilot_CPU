RAW RESPONSE:
**THINKING STEPS**

Step 1: Find knowledge about each pair of nodes. These are all computer architecture parameters related to processor design and performance metrics.

Step 2: Determine correlations based on domain knowledge of computer architecture.

Step 3: Determine causation relationships in processor design.

Step 4: Check for direct causal relationships without intermediate nodes.

Step 5: Determine direction of causation based on architectural design principles.

Step 6: Provide explanations based on computer architecture domain knowledge.
