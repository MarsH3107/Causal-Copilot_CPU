    "(enableSFBOpt, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Enabling store-to-load forwarding buffer optimization adds additional circuitry and logic gates that contribute to static power consumption through leakage currents;"
    },
    "(enableSFBOpt, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Store-to-load forwarding buffer optimization requires additional hardware components and logic circuits that directly increase the physical silicon area occupied by cells;"
    },
    "(enableSFBOpt, nDCacheMSHRs)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Store-to-load forwarding buffer optimization operates at the execution pipeline level and does not directly determine the number of data cache miss status holding registers;"
