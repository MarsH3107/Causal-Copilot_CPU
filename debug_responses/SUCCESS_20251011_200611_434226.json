      "explanation": "These are independent hardware configuration parameters for different TLB structures that do not directly influence each other's design or operation;"

      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing L2 TLB associativity reduces TLB miss rates which decreases memory access latency and subsequently improves cycles per instruction performance;"
