    "(power_pad, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power consumption of I/O pads does not directly influence processor execution time as pad power is primarily related to interface functionality rather than computational performance;"
    },
    "(power_pad, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Larger net areas in processor designs require more extensive I/O infrastructure and pad connections, which directly increases the power consumption associated with I/O pads;"
    },
    "(power_pad, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Increased cell area in processor designs necessitates more I/O pads for signal routing and power distribution, directly leading to higher pad power consumption;"
    }
