    "(nL2TLBEntries, nDCacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent design parameters where L2 TLB entries and data cache TLB associativity are configured separately without direct causal influence;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBEntries, power_logic)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing L2 TLB entries requires additional logic circuits for address translation and lookup operations, directly increasing logic power consumption;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of TLB entries and the associativity (ways) of the L2 TLB are independent architectural parameters that can be configured separately;"
