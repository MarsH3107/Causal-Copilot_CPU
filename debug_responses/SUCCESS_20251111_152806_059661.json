    "(cpi, power_memory)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher CPI increases execution time and memory access patterns, directly affecting memory subsystem power consumption through increased activity;"
    },
    "(cpi, power)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "CPI directly influences overall execution time and processor activity levels, which determines total power consumption across all processor components;"
    },
    "(cpi, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "CPI affects computational workload while pad power is primarily determined by I/O interface design and activity, with no direct causal relationship;"
    }
