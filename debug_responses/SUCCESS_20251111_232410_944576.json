    "(power_register, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Register file power consumption and I/O pad power consumption are independent components of total processor power, with no direct causal relationship between them;"
    },
    "(power_register, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Register file power consumption does not directly cause changes in execution time, as both are influenced by workload characteristics and design parameters independently;"
    },
    "(power_register, power_clock)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Register file power and clock distribution power are separate power domains in processor design with no direct causal relationship;"
    }
