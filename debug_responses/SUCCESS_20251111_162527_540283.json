    "(nL2TLBWays, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of ways in L2 TLB affects internal cache organization but has no direct relationship to pad power consumption, which is primarily determined by I/O interface design;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBWays, nICacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent cache design parameters for different cache levels and have no direct causal relationship with each other;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBWays, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of ways in L2 TLB requires more complex selection logic and multiplexers, which increases switching activity and dynamic power consumption;"
    }
