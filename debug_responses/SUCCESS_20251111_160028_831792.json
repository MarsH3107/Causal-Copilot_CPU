    "(numRXQEntries, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of receive queue entries requires additional hardware structures and interconnections, which directly increases the pad power consumption needed for external signal driving;"
    },
    "(numRXQEntries, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More receive queue entries mean more transistors and logic gates that switch during operation, directly increasing the dynamic switching power consumption;"
    },
    "(numRXQEntries, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Additional receive queue entries increase the complexity of hardware implementation and routing, which directly affects the critical path timing and overall execution time;"
    }
  }
