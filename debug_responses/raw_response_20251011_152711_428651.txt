**Context**: 
We want to carry out causal discovery analysis, considering these variables: BranchPredictor, fetchWidth, numFetchBufferEntries, numRasEntries, maxBrCount, decodeWidth, numRobEntries, numIntPhysRegisters, memIssueWidth, intIssueWidth, numLdqEntries, enablePrefetching, enableSFBOpt, numRXQEntries, numRCQEntries, nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBWays, nICacheWays, nICacheTLBWays, nDCacheWays, nDCacheMSHRs, nDCacheTLBWays, CPI, flush, ICacheMiss, DCacheMiss


**Your Task**:
Your task is to double check these causal relationships about node {main_node} from a domain knowledge perspective and determine whether this statistically suggested hypothesis is plausible in the context of the domain.
Firstly, determine the causal relationship between
 ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss, ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss, 

**Options**
- For each node pair, if I intervene the left node, it directly causes changes in the right node, the "result" is 'A'. 
- If I intervene the right node, it directly causes changes in

RAW RESPONSE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**THINKING STEPS**

Step 1: Find knowledge about each pair of nodes.
- ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss: These are instruction cache misses and data cache misses respectively in computer architecture. Both are performance metrics related to cache behavior.
- ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss: This is the same variable with itself.

Step 2: Determine correlation.
- ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss: These could be correlated as they both relate to cache performance, but they measure different types of cache misses.
- ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss: A variable is perfectly correlated with itself.

Step 3: Determine causation.
- ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss: While both are cache misses, instruction cache misses and data cache misses are fundamentally different events that occur independently based on different access patterns.
- ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss: A variable cannot cause itself in a meaningful causal sense.

Step 4: Determine if relationship is direct.
- ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss: No direct causal relationship exists between these independent cache miss types.
- ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss: Not applicable as this is the same variable.

Step 5: Determine direction.
- ICacheMiss and DCacheMiss: No causal direction as they are independent events.
- ICacheMiss and ICacheMiss: Not applicable.

Step 6: Provide explanation based on domain knowledge.

(ICacheMiss, DCacheMiss): C: Instruction cache misses and data cache misses are independent events that occur due to different memory access patterns and do not directly cause each other;
(ICacheMiss, ICacheMiss): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be a tautological relationship rather than a meaningful causal connection;
