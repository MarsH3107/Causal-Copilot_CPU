    "(numRXQEntries, numRXQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot cause itself as this would be circular and logically impossible;"
    },
    "(numRXQEntries, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of RXQ entries allows more memory requests to be buffered, reducing memory-related stalls and improving instruction throughput, thereby decreasing CPI;"
    },
    "(numRXQEntries, nICacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "RXQ entries are part of the memory subsystem while instruction cache associativity is a separate cache design parameter with no direct causal relationship;"
    }
