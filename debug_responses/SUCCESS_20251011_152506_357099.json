      "explanation": "These are independent architectural parameters that configure different TLB structures (L2 TLB and instruction cache TLB) and do not directly influence each other's design choices;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBWays, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of L2 TLB ways reduces TLB miss rates by improving address translation hit probability, which directly reduces memory access latency and decreases cycles per instruction;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBWays, nICacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of L2 TLB ways and instruction cache ways are independent architectural design parameters that configure different cache structures without direct causal relationship;"
