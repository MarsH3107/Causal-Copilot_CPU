    "(numLdqEntries, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of load queue entries allows more load instructions to be tracked simultaneously, reducing pipeline stalls and improving instruction throughput, which directly decreases cycles per instruction;"
    },
    "(numLdqEntries, nICacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of load queue entries and instruction cache associativity are independent architectural parameters that operate in different pipeline stages and do not directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(numLdqEntries, enableSFBOpt)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Load queue size and store-to-load forwarding optimization are independent features that can be configured separately without direct causal relationship;"
    }
