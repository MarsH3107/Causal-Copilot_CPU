    "(decodeWidth, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Decode width directly affects how many instructions can be decoded per cycle, which fundamentally determines the processor's instruction throughput and thus cycles per instruction;"
    },
    "(decodeWidth, memIssueWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Decode width and memory issue width are independent design parameters that operate at different pipeline stages and don't directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(decodeWidth, nICacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of instruction cache ways is a cache design parameter independent of decode width, as cache associativity doesn't depend on decode pipeline width;"
    }
  }
