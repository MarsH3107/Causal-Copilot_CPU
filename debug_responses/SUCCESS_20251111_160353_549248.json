    "(power_switching, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Switching power and execution time are independent metrics where switching power represents energy consumption per cycle while time represents total execution duration;"
    },
    "(power_switching, power_clock)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Switching power and clock power are separate components of total power consumption that operate independently in digital circuits;"
    },
    "(power_switching, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Larger interconnect areas increase wire capacitance which directly increases the switching power required to charge and discharge these capacitive loads;"
    }
