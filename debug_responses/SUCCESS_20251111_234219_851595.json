    "(maxBrCount, power_logic)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the maximum branch count requires more complex branch prediction logic circuits, which directly increases the power consumption of the logic components;"
    },
    "(maxBrCount, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher maximum branch count necessitates more transistors and larger circuit structures for branch prediction, leading to increased leakage power consumption;"
    },
    "(maxBrCount, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Supporting more simultaneous branches requires additional hardware resources and larger branch prediction structures, directly increasing the physical area occupied by cells;"
