    "(nL2TLBEntries, nDCacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent cache configuration parameters that operate at different levels of the memory hierarchy and do not directly influence each other's settings;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Both are independent configuration parameters of the L2 TLB structure where entries and ways are orthogonal design choices that don't causally affect each other;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBEntries, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing L2 TLB entries reduces TLB misses which decreases the frequency of page table walks, thereby reducing data cache pollution and potentially lowering data cache miss rates;"
    }
