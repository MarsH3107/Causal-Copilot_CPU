    "(power, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Power leakage is a fundamental component of total power consumption in processors, where leakage current through transistors directly contributes to the overall power budget;"
    },
    "(power, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power consumption and cell area are independent design metrics that can vary independently based on different architectural and implementation choices;"
    },
    "(power, power_register)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Register file power consumption is a specific component that directly contributes to the total power consumption of the processor;"
    }
