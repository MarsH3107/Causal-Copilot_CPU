    "(cpi, power_memory)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Memory power consumption affects CPI because higher memory power often correlates with more memory accesses and longer memory latencies, which increase the cycles needed per instruction;"
    },
    "(cpi, power)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Total power consumption influences CPI as higher power usage typically indicates more active components and potentially longer execution times, leading to more cycles per instruction;"
    },
    "(cpi, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Pad power consumption is related to I/O interface power and has no direct causal relationship with the cycles per instruction metric;"
    }
