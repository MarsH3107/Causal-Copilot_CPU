    "(numLdqEntries, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "The number of load queue entries directly affects processor performance by determining how many load operations can be tracked simultaneously, with insufficient entries causing pipeline stalls and increased cycles per instruction;"
    },
    "(numLdqEntries, nICacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of load queue entries and instruction cache associativity are independent architectural parameters that operate in different parts of the processor pipeline;"
    },
    "(numLdqEntries, enableSFBOpt)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Load queue size and store-to-load forwarding optimization are independent architectural features that don't directly influence each other's configuration;"
    }
