    "(nICacheWays, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of instruction cache ways requires additional transistors and memory cells, which directly increases static power consumption through leakage currents;"
    },
    "(nICacheWays, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More instruction cache ways necessitate additional memory cells and associated circuitry, directly increasing the total cell area on the chip;"
    },
    "(nICacheWays, nDCacheMSHRs)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of instruction cache ways and data cache miss status holding registers are independent design parameters that serve different functions in the memory hierarchy;"
    }
