    "(power_internal, power_logic)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Power_logic is a component of power_internal, where logic circuits contribute to the total internal power consumption of the processor;"
    },
    "(power_internal, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Larger cell area typically leads to higher power consumption due to increased capacitance and longer interconnects, thus area_cell_area influences power_internal;"
    },
    "(power_internal, power_register)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Power_register represents the power consumed by register files and is a component that contributes to the total power_internal of the processor;"
    }
  }
