Line   1 | Starts with '(': False | **THINKING STEPS**
Line   2 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   3 | Starts with '(': False | Step 1: Find knowledge about each pair of nodes. These are all computer architecture parameters related to CPU design and performance metrics.
Line   4 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   5 | Starts with '(': False | Step 2-6: I'll analyze each pair systematically based on computer architecture domain knowledge.
Line   6 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   7 | Starts with '(': False | **Response:**
Line   8 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   9 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, intIssueWidth): C: Memory issue width and integer issue width are independent architectural parameters that can be configured separately, as they control different execution units in the processor pipeline;
Line  10 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  11 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, nICacheTLBWays): C: Memory issue width affects memory operation throughput while instruction cache TLB ways determine address translation capacity, representing independent architectural design choices;
Line  12 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  13 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, numRXQEntries): C: Memory issue width controls memory operation dispatch rate while RXQ entries manage network packet reception, representing independent subsystem parameters;
Line  14 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  15 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, CPI): A: Memory issue width directly affects the processor's ability to execute memory operations in parallel, which influences overall instruction throughput and cycles per instruction;
Line  16 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  17 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, memIssueWidth): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself;
Line  18 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  19 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, nICacheWays): C: Memory issue width affects memory operation execution while instruction cache ways determine cache associativity, representing independent architectural parameters;
Line  20 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  21 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, enableSFBOpt): C: Memory issue width is a hardware parameter while store-to-load forwarding optimization is a separate microarchitectural feature that can be enabled independently;
Line  22 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  23 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Memory issue width controls execution throughput while data cache TLB associativity affects address translation, representing independent design parameters;
Line  24 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  25 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, nL2TLBWays): C: Memory issue width affects execution pipeline throughput while L2 TLB associativity determines address translation capacity, representing independent architectural choices;
Line  26 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  27 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, enablePrefetching): C: Memory issue width is a pipeline parameter while prefetching is an independent optimization technique that can be enabled regardless of issue width;
Line  28 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  29 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, DCacheMiss): A: Memory issue width affects the rate at which memory operations are issued, which can influence data cache miss patterns through increased memory access pressure;
Line  30 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  31 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Memory issue width controls execution throughput while MSHR entries manage outstanding cache misses, representing independent architectural parameters;
Line  32 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  33 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, nL2TLBEntries): C: Memory issue width affects pipeline throughput while L2 TLB entries determine address translation capacity, representing independent design choices;
Line  34 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  35 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, ICacheMiss): C: Memory issue width primarily affects data memory operations while instruction cache misses are related to instruction fetch patterns, representing largely independent phenomena;
Line  36 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  37 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, numLdqEntries): A: Memory issue width directly affects how many load operations can be issued per cycle, which influences the required capacity of the load queue to buffer pending loads;
Line  38 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  39 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, nDCacheWays): C: Memory issue width controls execution throughput while data cache associativity affects cache organization, representing independent architectural parameters;
Line  40 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  41 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, numRCQEntries): C: Memory issue width affects memory operation dispatch while RCQ entries manage network response handling, representing independent subsystem parameters;
Line  42 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  43 | Starts with '(': True  | (memIssueWidth, flush): A: Memory issue width affects the number of in-flight memory operations, which can influence pipeline flush frequency when memory ordering violations or exceptions occur;
