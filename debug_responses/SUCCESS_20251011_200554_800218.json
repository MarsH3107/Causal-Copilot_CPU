      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as it represents the same entity;"
    },
    "(numRXQEntries, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of RXQ entries can reduce memory request stalls and improve instruction throughput, thereby potentially reducing cycles per instruction;"
    },

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of receive queue entries and instruction cache associativity are independent hardware configuration parameters that do not directly influence each other;"
