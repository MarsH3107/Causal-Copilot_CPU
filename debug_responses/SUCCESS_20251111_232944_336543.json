    "(power_pad, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power consumption of I/O pads does not directly influence processor execution timing, as pad power is primarily related to interface operations rather than computational performance;"
    },
    "(power_pad, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "I/O pad power consumption and interconnect net area are independent design metrics that do not directly influence each other in processor architecture;"
    },
    "(power_pad, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power consumption of I/O pads and the physical area of logic cells are separate design parameters that do not have a direct causal relationship;"
    }
