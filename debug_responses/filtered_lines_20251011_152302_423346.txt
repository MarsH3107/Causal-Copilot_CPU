1. (CPI, flush): B: Pipeline flush events directly increase the cycles per instruction because flushed instructions must be re-fetched and re-executed, adding extra cycles without completing useful work;
2. (CPI, CPI): C: This represents the same variable with itself, so there is no meaningful causal relationship to analyze;
3. (CPI, DCacheMiss): B: Data cache misses cause the processor to stall while waiting for data from slower memory levels, directly increasing the number of cycles required per instruction;
4. (CPI, ICacheMiss): B: Instruction cache misses force the processor to fetch instructions from slower memory levels, creating pipeline stalls that increase the cycles needed per instruction;
