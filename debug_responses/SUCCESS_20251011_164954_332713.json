      "explanation": "These are independent cache configuration parameters that operate at different levels of the memory hierarchy and do not directly influence each other's design or operation;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBWays, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of L2 TLB ways reduces TLB miss rates by improving address translation hit rates, which directly decreases memory access latency and thus reduces cycles per instruction;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBWays, nICacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "L2 TLB associativity and instruction cache associativity are independent architectural parameters that serve different functions in the memory hierarchy without direct causal relationship;"
