    "(memIssueWidth, intIssueWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory issue width and integer issue width are independent architectural parameters that can be configured separately, as they control different execution units in the processor pipeline;"
    },
    "(memIssueWidth, nICacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory issue width affects memory operation throughput while instruction cache TLB ways determine address translation capacity, representing independent architectural design choices;"
    },
    "(memIssueWidth, numRXQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory issue width controls memory operation dispatch rate while RXQ entries manage network packet reception, representing independent subsystem parameters;"
    }
