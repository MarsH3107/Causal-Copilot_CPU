      "explanation": "Register file power consumption and I/O pad power consumption are independent components of total processor power, with no direct causal relationship between them;"

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Register file power consumption and execution timing are independent metrics that result from separate design decisions and operational characteristics;"
