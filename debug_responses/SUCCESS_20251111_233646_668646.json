    "(numRobEntries, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing ROB entries requires more storage cells and associated logic, directly increasing the physical cell area needed for implementation;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, power_register)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More ROB entries mean more register-like storage elements that consume power for data retention and access operations;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "ROB size and L2 TLB entries serve different functions in the processor pipeline and do not have a direct causal relationship;"
    }
