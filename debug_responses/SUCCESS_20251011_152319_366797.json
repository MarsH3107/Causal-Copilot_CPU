    "(numFetchBufferEntries, numRXQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent architectural parameters where fetch buffer entries handle instruction fetching while RXQ entries manage memory request queues, with no direct causal relationship between their sizing decisions;"
    },
    "(numFetchBufferEntries, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of fetch buffer entries can reduce instruction fetch stalls and improve instruction throughput, thereby potentially reducing cycles per instruction;"
    },
    "(numFetchBufferEntries, memIssueWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Fetch buffer entries and memory issue width are independent architectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages with no direct causal relationship;"
    }
