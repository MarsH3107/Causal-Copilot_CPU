    "(power_memory, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory power consumption and physical cell area are both outcomes of underlying design parameters but do not directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(power_memory, power_register)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory power and register power are independent components of total processor power consumption with separate underlying mechanisms;"
    },
    "(power_memory, area_cell_count)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory power consumption and cell count are both results of design choices but do not have a direct causal relationship;"
