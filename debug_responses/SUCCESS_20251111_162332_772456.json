    "(power_pad, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power consumption of I/O pads does not directly influence processor execution time, as timing is primarily determined by critical path delays in the core logic rather than pad power characteristics;"
    },
    "(power_pad, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "The net area requirements in a processor design determine the number and complexity of I/O pads needed, which subsequently affects the power consumption of those pads;"
    },
    "(power_pad, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Larger cell areas in processor designs typically require more extensive I/O infrastructure and pad resources, leading to increased pad power consumption;"
    }
  }
