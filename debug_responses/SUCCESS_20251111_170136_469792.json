    "(power_logic, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Logic power consumption and timing are both outcomes of the same design decisions but do not directly cause each other in processor architecture;"
    },
    "(power_logic, power_clock)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Logic power and clock power are separate components of total power consumption that operate independently without direct causal relationship;"
    },
    "(power_logic, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Logic power consumption and net area are both consequences of design complexity but do not have a direct causal relationship;"
