    "(enablePrefetching, numRCQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Prefetching enablement is a configuration setting while RCQ entries are hardware buffer sizes that are typically fixed at design time and independent of prefetching configuration;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, power)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Enabling prefetching increases processor activity by generating additional memory requests and activating prefetch logic, which directly increases overall power consumption;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Prefetching configuration does not affect the physical pad structures or their associated power consumption as these are fixed hardware design elements;"
    }
  }
