    "(maxBrCount, power_logic)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing maxBrCount requires more complex branch prediction logic circuits, directly increasing the power consumption of logic components;"
    },
    "(maxBrCount, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher maxBrCount necessitates more transistors in branch prediction hardware, leading to increased static leakage power consumption;"
    },
    "(maxBrCount, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Larger maxBrCount requires more hardware resources for branch prediction tables and logic, directly increasing the physical area occupied by cells;"
