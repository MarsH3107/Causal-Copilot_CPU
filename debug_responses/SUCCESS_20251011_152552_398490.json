      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be logically inconsistent and meaningless in any causal analysis;"
    },
    "(nDCacheMSHRs, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of data cache MSHRs is a hardware configuration parameter for data cache miss handling, while instruction cache misses are independent events related to instruction fetching that do not directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(nDCacheMSHRs, flush)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of data cache MSHRs is a static hardware configuration parameter that determines miss handling capacity, while pipeline flushes are dynamic events triggered by control flow changes or hazards, with no direct causal relationship;"
