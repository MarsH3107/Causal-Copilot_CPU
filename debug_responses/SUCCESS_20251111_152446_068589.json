    "(power_register, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These represent power consumption in different and independent components of the processor architecture, with register files and I/O pads serving distinct functions;"
    },
    "(power_register, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Register file power consumption is a consequence of design choices and does not directly influence the execution time of programs;"
    },
    "(power_register, power_clock)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These represent independent power consumption components in the processor, with clock distribution and register files being separate functional units;"
    }
