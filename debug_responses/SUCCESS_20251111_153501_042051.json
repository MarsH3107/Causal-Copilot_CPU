    "(power_logic, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Logic power consumption and execution time are independent metrics that don't directly cause each other, though both may be influenced by design complexity;"
    },
    "(power_logic, power_clock)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Logic power and clock power are separate components of total power consumption that operate independently, with no direct causal relationship between them;"
    },
    "(power_logic, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Logic power consumption and net area are independent design metrics, as power depends on switching activity while net area depends on placement and routing;"
    }
