    "(power_switching, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power switching consumption and execution time are independent metrics where switching power represents energy consumed during transistor state changes while execution time measures performance;"
    },
    "(power_switching, power_clock)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Both switching power and clock power are separate components of total processor power consumption that operate independently in the power breakdown hierarchy;"
    },
    "(power_switching, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Switching power consumption and net area are independent metrics where power represents dynamic energy usage while net area is a physical design constraint;"
    }
