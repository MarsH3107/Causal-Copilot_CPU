      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of data cache TLB ways reduces TLB miss rates, which decreases memory access latency and directly improves processor performance by reducing cycles per instruction;"

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "While TLB performance affects memory access patterns, the number of TLB ways does not directly cause data cache misses, which are primarily determined by data access patterns and cache size;"
