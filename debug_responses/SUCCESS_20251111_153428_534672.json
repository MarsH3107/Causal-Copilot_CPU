    "(power_switching, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher switching power consumption can lead to thermal throttling and power management interventions that reduce processor frequency, thereby increasing execution time;"
    },
    "(power_switching, power_clock)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Switching power and clock power are independent components of total power consumption, with switching power arising from logic state changes and clock power from clock distribution networks;"
    },
    "(power_switching, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Switching power is a dynamic electrical property while net area is a static physical layout characteristic, with no direct causal relationship between power consumption and interconnect area;"
    }
