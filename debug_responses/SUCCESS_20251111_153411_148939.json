    "(maxBrCount, power_logic)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher maximum branch count requires more complex branch prediction logic and control circuits, directly increasing the power consumption of logic components;"
    },
    "(maxBrCount, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increased branch prediction complexity requires additional transistors and larger circuit structures, which directly increases static leakage power consumption;"
    },
    "(maxBrCount, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Supporting higher maximum branch counts necessitates larger branch prediction tables and more complex control logic, directly increasing the physical area occupied by cells;"
