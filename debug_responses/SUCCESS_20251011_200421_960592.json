    "(nICacheWays, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Instruction cache associativity and data cache miss events are independent since they operate on different memory access patterns and do not directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(nICacheWays, nDCacheMSHRs)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of ways in instruction cache and the number of miss status holding registers in data cache are independent architectural parameters that do not causally affect each other;"
    },
    "(nICacheWays, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of ways in instruction cache reduces conflict misses by providing more storage locations for cache lines, directly decreasing instruction cache miss rates;"
    }
