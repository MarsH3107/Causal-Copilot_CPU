    "(BranchPredictor, decodeWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Branch predictor accuracy and decode width are independent architectural design parameters that don't directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(BranchPredictor, numRCQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Branch predictor mechanisms and the number of request completion queue entries are separate architectural components with no direct causal relationship;"
    },
    "(BranchPredictor, flush)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Poor branch prediction accuracy directly causes pipeline flushes when mispredictions occur, requiring the processor to discard incorrectly fetched instructions;"
    }
