    "(enablePrefetching, numRCQEntries)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Enabling prefetching increases memory traffic and requires more request completion queue entries to handle the additional outstanding memory requests;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, power)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Prefetching activates additional hardware units and increases memory access frequency, directly leading to higher overall power consumption;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Prefetching increases I/O activity and signal transitions at chip boundaries, resulting in higher pad power consumption;"
    }
  }
