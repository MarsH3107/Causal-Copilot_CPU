Line   1 | Starts with '(': False | **THINKING STEPS**
Line   2 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   3 | Starts with '(': False | Step 1: Find knowledge about each pair of nodes. These are all computer architecture parameters related to CPU design and performance metrics.
Line   4 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   5 | Starts with '(': False | Step 2-6: I'll analyze each pair systematically based on computer architecture domain knowledge.
Line   6 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   7 | Starts with '(': False | **Response:**
Line   8 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   9 | Starts with '(': True  | (BranchPredictor, decodeWidth): C: Branch predictor accuracy and decode width are independent architectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages and do not directly influence each other's configuration;
Line  10 | Starts with '(': False |

Line  12 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  13 | Starts with '(': True  | (BranchPredictor, flush): A: Branch mispredictions directly cause pipeline flushes as the processor must discard incorrectly fetched and decoded instructions when the actual branch outcome differs from the prediction;
Line  14 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  15 | Starts with '(': True  | (BranchPredictor, BranchPredictor): C: A node cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular and meaningless in causal analysis;
