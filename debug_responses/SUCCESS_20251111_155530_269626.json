    "(enablePrefetching, numRCQEntries)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Enabling prefetching increases memory requests which requires more request completion queue entries to handle the additional outstanding requests;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, power)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Enabling prefetching increases processor activity through additional memory accesses and cache operations, directly leading to higher overall power consumption;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Prefetching increases I/O activity and signal transitions at processor pads, leading to higher pad power consumption;"
    }
