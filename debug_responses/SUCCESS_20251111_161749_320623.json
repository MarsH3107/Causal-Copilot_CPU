    "(nICacheTLBWays, power_internal)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of TLB ways requires additional hardware structures and logic circuits, which directly increases internal power consumption due to more active transistors and switching activity;"
    },
    "(nICacheTLBWays, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More TLB ways necessitate additional storage cells and interconnect routing to support the increased associativity, directly increasing the net area occupied by wiring and connections;"
    },
    "(nICacheTLBWays, nDCacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of ways in the instruction cache TLB and data cache TLB are independent architectural design parameters that do not causally influence each other;"
