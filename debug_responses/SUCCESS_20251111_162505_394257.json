    "(fetchWidth, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing fetch width requires more parallel instruction fetch logic and wider data paths, directly increasing the physical area occupied by cells in the processor design;"
    },
    "(fetchWidth, power_register)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Wider fetch width necessitates more registers and register file ports to handle the increased instruction throughput, directly increasing register-related power consumption;"
    },
    "(fetchWidth, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Fetch width affects instruction fetch bandwidth while L2 TLB entries are determined by memory management requirements and are independent architectural decisions;"
    }
