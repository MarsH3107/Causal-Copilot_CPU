    "(power_pad, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power consumption of I/O pads does not directly influence processor execution timing, as pad power is primarily related to interface operations rather than computational performance;"
    },
    "(power_pad, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "I/O pad power consumption and interconnect net area are independent design metrics that do not directly influence each other, as pad power relates to interface circuitry while net area relates to routing topology;"
    },
    "(power_pad, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power consumption of I/O pads and the physical area of logic cells are independent design parameters, as pad power relates to interface circuits while cell area relates to computational logic implementation;"
