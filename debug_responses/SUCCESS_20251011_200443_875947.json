    "(numRobEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent microarchitectural parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "ROB size does not directly cause instruction cache misses, as cache misses depend on access patterns and cache configuration rather than ROB capacity;"
    },
    "(numRobEntries, numLdqEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Both are queue sizing parameters that are typically configured independently based on different performance considerations;"
