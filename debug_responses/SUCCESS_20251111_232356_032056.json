    "(nICacheTLBWays, power_internal)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing instruction cache TLB associativity requires additional comparison logic and storage elements, which directly increases internal power consumption due to more active transistors and switching activity;"
    },
    "(nICacheTLBWays, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher TLB associativity necessitates additional routing and interconnect structures to support the increased comparison logic and data paths, directly increasing the net area on the chip;"
    },
    "(nICacheTLBWays, nDCacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The associativity of instruction cache TLB and data cache TLB are independent architectural design parameters that do not causally influence each other;"
