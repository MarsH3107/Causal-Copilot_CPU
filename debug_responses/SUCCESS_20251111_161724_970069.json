    "(power_internal, power_logic)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Power_logic is a component that contributes to the total internal power consumption of a processor, making logic power a constituent part of internal power;"
    },
    "(power_internal, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Cell area is a physical design metric that doesn't directly cause or result from internal power consumption, though both may be influenced by design choices;"
    },
    "(power_internal, power_register)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Register power consumption is a specific component that contributes to the overall internal power consumption of the processor;"
    }
