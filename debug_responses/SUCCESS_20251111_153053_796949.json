    "(numRXQEntries, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of receive queue entries requires additional hardware structures that need I/O connections, directly increasing pad power consumption;"
    },
    "(numRXQEntries, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More receive queue entries mean more transistors and logic gates that switch during operation, directly increasing dynamic switching power;"
    },
    "(numRXQEntries, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Larger receive queues can improve memory parallelism and reduce stalls, potentially decreasing execution time;"
    }
