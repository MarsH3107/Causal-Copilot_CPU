1. (decodeWidth, CPI): A: Decode width directly affects processor performance by determining how many instructions can be decoded per cycle, with wider decode stages typically reducing CPI by enabling higher instruction throughput;
2. (decodeWidth, memIssueWidth): C: Decode width and memory issue width are independent microarchitectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages and do not directly influence each other;
3. (decodeWidth, nICacheWays): C: Decode width is a pipeline parameter while instruction cache associativity is a memory hierarchy design choice, making them independent architectural decisions;
4. (decodeWidth, enableSFBOpt): C: Decode width affects instruction processing bandwidth while store-to-load forwarding optimization is a memory subsystem feature, making them independent design parameters;
5. (decodeWidth, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Decode width operates in the front-end pipeline while data cache TLB associativity is a memory management unit design parameter, making them independent;
6. (decodeWidth, numIntPhysRegisters): C: Decode width determines instruction processing rate while the number of physical registers is a register file sizing decision, making them independent architectural choices;
7. (decodeWidth, nL2TLBWays): C: Decode width affects front-end throughput while L2 TLB associativity is a memory management design parameter, making them independent components;
8. (decodeWidth, DCacheMiss): A: Decode width can indirectly influence data cache miss rates by affecting the rate at which memory-accessing instructions are processed and enter the pipeline;
9. (decodeWidth, enablePrefetching): C: Decode width affects instruction processing bandwidth while prefetching is a memory subsystem optimization technique, making them independent design decisions;
10. (decodeWidth, numRobEntries): C: Decode width determines front-end throughput while ROB size is a back-end resource allocation decision, though both affect overall performance independently;
11. (decodeWidth, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Decode width affects instruction processing rate while data cache MSHR count is a memory subsystem resource allocation, making them independent parameters;
12. (decodeWidth, nL2TLBEntries): C: Decode width operates in the instruction pipeline while L2 TLB capacity is a memory management unit sizing decision, making them independent;
13. (decodeWidth, ICacheMiss): A: Decode width can influence instruction cache miss patterns by affecting the rate at which instructions are fetched and processed from the cache;
14. (decodeWidth, numLdqEntries): C: Decode width affects front-end throughput while load queue size is a memory subsystem resource allocation, making them independent design parameters;
15. (decodeWidth, nDCacheWays): C: Decode width determines instruction processing bandwidth while data cache associativity is a memory hierarchy design choice, making them independent;
16. (decodeWidth, decodeWidth): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular and logically invalid;
17. (decodeWidth, numRCQEntries): C: Decode width affects instruction processing rate while request completion queue size is a memory subsystem parameter, making them independent;
18. (decodeWidth, flush): A: Decode width can influence pipeline flush frequency by affecting the rate at which instructions are processed and potential mispredictions are detected;
19. (decodeWidth, intIssueWidth): C: Decode width and integer issue width are independent pipeline parameters that operate at different stages and are sized based on separate design considerations;
20. (decodeWidth, nICacheTLBWays): C: Decode width affects instruction processing bandwidth while instruction cache TLB associativity is a memory management design parameter, making them independent;
21. (decodeWidth, numRXQEntries): C: Decode width operates in the instruction pipeline while request transmit queue size is a memory subsystem parameter, making them independent design choices;
