1. (enablePrefetching, numRCQEntries): C: Prefetching is a performance optimization technique while RCQ entries are hardware buffer resources that are typically determined during processor design phase independently;
2. (enablePrefetching, flush): A: Enabling prefetching can increase the likelihood of pipeline flushes when mispredicted prefetches bring incorrect data into the cache hierarchy, requiring pipeline restart;
3. (enablePrefetching, nICacheTLBWays): C: Prefetching enablement is a runtime configuration while instruction cache TLB associativity is a fixed hardware design parameter determined during processor architecture design;
4. (enablePrefetching, numRXQEntries): C: Prefetching configuration operates independently from the number of receive queue entries, which are hardware resources allocated during processor design;
5. (enablePrefetching, CPI): A: Enabling prefetching directly affects cycles per instruction by potentially reducing memory access latency through proactive data fetching, though it may sometimes increase CPI due to cache pollution;
6. (enablePrefetching, nICacheWays): C: Prefetching enablement is a software/firmware configuration while instruction cache associativity is a fixed hardware design parameter;
7. (enablePrefetching, enableSFBOpt): C: These are independent optimization features that can be enabled or disabled separately without one directly causing changes in the other;
8. (enablePrefetching, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Prefetching configuration is independent from data cache TLB associativity, which is a fixed hardware design parameter;
9. (enablePrefetching, nL2TLBWays): C: Prefetching enablement operates independently from L2 TLB associativity, which is determined during processor hardware design;
10. (enablePrefetching, DCacheMiss): A: Enabling prefetching directly affects data cache miss rates by proactively fetching data before it is needed, potentially reducing cache misses;
11. (enablePrefetching, enablePrefetching): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself;
12. (enablePrefetching, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Prefetching configuration is independent from the number of miss status holding registers, which are fixed hardware resources;
13. (enablePrefetching, nL2TLBEntries): C: Prefetching enablement operates independently from L2 TLB size, which is a fixed hardware design parameter;
14. (enablePrefetching, ICacheMiss): A: Enabling prefetching can affect instruction cache miss rates by potentially prefetching instructions ahead of execution, though the primary impact is usually on data cache performance;
15. (enablePrefetching, nDCacheWays): C: Prefetching configuration operates independently from data cache associativity, which is a fixed hardware design parameter determined during processor architecture design
