      "explanation": "The number of ways in the instruction cache TLB and data cache TLB are independent design parameters that do not directly influence each other, as they serve different cache subsystems;"

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The associativity of the instruction cache TLB does not directly affect data cache miss rates since they operate on different memory access patterns and address translation paths;"
