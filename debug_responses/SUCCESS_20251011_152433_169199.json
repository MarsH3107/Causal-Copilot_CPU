    "(decodeWidth, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Decode width directly affects processor performance by determining how many instructions can be decoded per cycle, with wider decode stages typically reducing CPI by enabling higher instruction throughput;"
    },
    "(decodeWidth, memIssueWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Decode width and memory issue width are independent microarchitectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages and do not directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(decodeWidth, nICacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Decode width is a pipeline parameter while instruction cache associativity is a memory hierarchy design choice, making them independent architectural decisions;"
    }
  }
