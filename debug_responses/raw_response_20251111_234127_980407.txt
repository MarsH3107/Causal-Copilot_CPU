RAW RESPONSE:
**THINKING STEPS**

Step 1: Find knowledge about each pair of nodes in the context of computer architecture and processor design.

Step 2: Determine correlations - in processor design, power consumption is typically composed of various components including leakage, switching, internal, memory, register, logic, clock, and pad power. Area metrics include cell count, cell area, and net area.

Step 3: Determine causation - Total power is fundamentally the sum of its component parts, and area is composed of its constituent elements.

Step 4: Determine if relationships are direct - The component powers directly contribute to total power, and area components directly contribute to total area.

Step 5: Determine direction - Component powers cause changes in total power (not vice versa), and area components cause changes in total area.

Step 6: Provide explanations based on domain knowledge.
