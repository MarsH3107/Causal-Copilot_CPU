**Context**: 
We want to carry out causal discovery analysis, considering these variables: BranchPredictor, fetchWidth, numFetchBufferEntries, numRasEntries, maxBrCount, decodeWidth, numRobEntries, numIntPhysRegisters, memIssueWidth, intIssueWidth, numLdqEntries, enablePrefetching, enableSFBOpt, numRXQEntries, numRCQEntries, nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBWays, nICacheWays, nICacheTLBWays, nDCacheWays, nDCacheMSHRs, nDCacheTLBWays, CPI, flush, ICacheMiss, DCacheMiss


**Your Task**:
Your task is to double check these causal relationships about node {main_node} from a domain knowledge perspective and determine whether this statistically suggested hypothesis is plausible in the context of the domain.
Firstly, determine the causal relationship between
 decodeWidth and CPI, decodeWidth and memIssueWidth, decodeWidth and nICacheWays, decodeWidth and enableSFBOpt, decodeWidth and nDCacheTLBWays, decodeWidth and numIntPhysRegisters, decodeWidth and nL2TLBWays, decodeWidth and DCacheMiss, decodeWidth an

RAW RESPONSE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(decodeWidth, CPI): A: Decode width directly affects processor performance by determining how many instructions can be decoded per cycle, with wider decode stages typically reducing CPI by enabling higher instruction throughput;

(decodeWidth, memIssueWidth): C: Decode width and memory issue width are independent microarchitectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages and do not directly influence each other;

(decodeWidth, nICacheWays): C: Decode width is a pipeline parameter while instruction cache associativity is a memory hierarchy design choice, making them independent architectural decisions;

(decodeWidth, enableSFBOpt): C: Decode width affects instruction processing bandwidth while store-to-load forwarding optimization is a memory subsystem feature, making them independent design parameters;

(decodeWidth, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Decode width operates in the front-end pipeline while data cache TLB associativity is a memory management unit design parameter, making them independent;

(decodeWidth, numIntPhysRegisters): C: Decode width determines instruction processing rate while the number of physical registers is a register file sizing decision, making them independent architectural choices;

(decodeWidth, nL2TLBWays): C: Decode width affects front-end throughput while L2 TLB associativity is a memory management design parameter, making them independent components;

(decodeWidth, DCacheMiss): A: Decode width can indirectly influence data cache miss rates by affecting the rate at which memory-accessing instructions are processed and enter the pipeline;

(decodeWidth, enablePrefetching): C: Decode width affects instruction processing bandwidth while prefetching is a memory subsystem optimization technique, making them independent design decisions;

(decodeWidth, numRobEntries): C: Decode width determines front-end throughput while ROB size is a back-end resource allocation decision, though both affect overall performance independently;

(decodeWidth, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Decode width affects instruction processing rate while data cache MSHR count is a memory subsystem resource allocation, making them independent parameters;

(decodeWidth, nL2TLBEntries): C: Decode width operates in the instruction pipeline while L2 TLB capacity is a memory management unit sizing decision, making them independent;

(decodeWidth, ICacheMiss): A: Decode width can influence instruction cache miss patterns by affecting the rate at which instructions are fetched and processed from the cache;

(decodeWidth, numLdqEntries): C: Decode width affects front-end throughput while load queue size is a memory subsystem resource allocation, making them independent design parameters;

(decodeWidth, nDCacheWays): C: Decode width determines instruction processing bandwidth while data cache associativity is a memory hierarchy design choice, making them independent;

(decodeWidth, decodeWidth): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular and logically invalid;

(decodeWidth, numRCQEntries): C: Decode width affects instruction processing rate while request completion queue size is a memory subsystem parameter, making them independent;

(decodeWidth, flush): A: Decode width can influence pipeline flush frequency by affecting the rate at which instructions are processed and potential mispredictions are detected;

(decodeWidth, intIssueWidth): C: Decode width and integer issue width are independent pipeline parameters that operate at different stages and are sized based on separate design considerations;

(decodeWidth, nICacheTLBWays): C: Decode width affects instruction processing bandwidth while instruction cache TLB associativity is a memory management design parameter, making them independent;

(decodeWidth, numRXQEntries): C: Decode width operates in the instruction pipeline while request transmit queue size is a memory subsystem parameter, making them independent design choices;
