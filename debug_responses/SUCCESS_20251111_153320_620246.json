    "(power, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Power leakage is a fundamental component of total power consumption in processors, where leakage current through transistors directly contributes to the overall power dissipation;"
    },
    "(power, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power consumption and cell area are independent design metrics that do not have a direct causal relationship, as power depends on switching activity and voltage while area depends on physical layout;"
    },
    "(power, power_register)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Register power consumption is a specific component of total processor power, where the power consumed by register files directly contributes to the overall power budget;"
    }
