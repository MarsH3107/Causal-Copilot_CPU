RAW RESPONSE:
(nL2TLBEntries, nDCacheTLBWays): C: These are independent cache configuration parameters that operate at different levels of the memory hierarchy and do not directly influence each other's settings;

(nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBWays): C: Both are independent configuration parameters of the L2 TLB structure where entries and ways are orthogonal design choices that don't causally affect each other;

(nL2TLBEntries, DCacheMiss): A: Increasing L2 TLB entries reduces TLB misses which decreases the frequency of page table walks, thereby reducing data cache pollution and potentially lowering data cache miss rates;

(nL2TLBEntries, nDCacheMSHRs): C: L2 TLB entries and data cache MSHRs are independent architectural parameters serving different functions in the memory subsystem;

(nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBEntries): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be a tautological relationship;

(nL2TLBEntries, ICacheMiss): A: More L2 TLB entries reduce TLB misses and page table walks, which decreases instruction cache pollution from page table data, potentially reducing instruction cache miss rates;

(nL2TLBEntries, nDCacheWays): C: L2 TLB entries and data cache associativity are independent architectural design parameters that don't directly influence each other;

(nL2TLBEntries, flush): A: More L2 TLB entries reduce TLB miss rates and associated pipeline stalls, which can decrease the frequency of pipeline flushes due to memory-related performance issues;

(nL2TLBEntries, nICacheTLBWays): C: L2 TLB entries and instruction cache TLB ways are independent configuration parameters operating at different levels of the TLB hierarchy;

(nL2TLBEntries, CPI): A: Increasing L2 TLB entries reduces TLB miss penalties and associated memory stalls, directly improving cycles per instruction by reducing pipeline delays;

(nL2TLBEntries, nICacheWays): C: L2 TLB entries and instruction cache associativity are independent architectural parameters that serve different functions in the processor design
