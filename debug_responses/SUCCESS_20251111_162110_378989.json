    "(numRCQEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent microarchitectural parameters where the number of request completion queue entries does not directly influence the number of L2 TLB entries;"
    },
    "(numRCQEntries, area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of RCQ entries requires additional hardware structures and storage elements, which directly increases the total chip area;"
    },
    "(numRCQEntries, area_cell_count)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More RCQ entries necessitate additional memory cells and logic gates to implement the queue structure, directly increasing the cell count;"
    }
