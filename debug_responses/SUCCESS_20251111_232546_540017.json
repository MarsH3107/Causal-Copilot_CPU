    "(numLdqEntries, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of load queue entries requires more switching transistors and logic gates, directly increasing switching power consumption;"
    },
    "(numLdqEntries, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More load queue entries increase the complexity of scheduling and selection logic, potentially increasing critical path delays and execution time;"
    },
    "(numLdqEntries, cpi)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Additional load queue entries can reduce memory-related stalls by allowing more outstanding loads, thereby decreasing cycles per instruction;"
    }
