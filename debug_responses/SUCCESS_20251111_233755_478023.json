    "(power_memory, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory power consumption and physical cell area are both outcomes of the underlying circuit design and manufacturing process, but neither directly causes changes in the other;"
    },
    "(power_memory, power_register)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory power consumption and register power consumption are independent power metrics measured for different processor components and do not directly influence each other;"
    },
    "(power_memory, area_cell_count)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory power consumption and cell count are both design parameters that result from architectural decisions, but neither directly causes changes in the other;"
    }
