    "(nDCacheTLBWays, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of TLB ways requires additional hardware structures and interconnects, which directly increases the power consumption of pad circuits needed for external connections;"
    },
    "(nDCacheTLBWays, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More TLB ways require additional comparators and selection logic that switch more frequently during address translation, directly increasing dynamic switching power consumption;"
    },
    "(nDCacheTLBWays, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher TLB associativity can reduce TLB miss rates and improve memory access latency, potentially reducing overall execution time;"
    }
