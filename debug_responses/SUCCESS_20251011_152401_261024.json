    "(nDCacheTLBWays, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of ways in the data cache TLB reduces TLB miss rates and memory access latency, which directly decreases the cycles per instruction by improving memory system performance;"
    },
    "(nDCacheTLBWays, nDCacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be logically inconsistent and meaningless in any causal analysis;"
    },
    "(nDCacheTLBWays, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher associativity in the data cache TLB reduces TLB conflicts and improves virtual-to-physical address translation efficiency, which can reduce data cache miss rates by enabling more effective memory access patterns;"
