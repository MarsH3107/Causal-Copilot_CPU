Line   1 | Starts with '(': False | **THINKING STEPS**
Line   2 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   3 | Starts with '(': False | Step 1: Find knowledge about each pair of nodes. These are all computer architecture parameters related to CPU design and performance metrics.
Line   4 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   5 | Starts with '(': False | Step 2-6: I'll analyze each pair systematically based on computer architecture domain knowledge.
Line   6 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   7 | Starts with '(': False | **Response:**
Line   8 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   9 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, nL2TLBEntries): C: Fetch width determines how many instructions can be fetched per cycle, while L2 TLB entries affect address translation capacity - these are independent architectural parameters that don't directly influence each other;
Line  10 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  11 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, ICacheMiss): A: Higher fetch width can increase instruction cache pressure by requesting more instructions per cycle, potentially leading to more cache misses when the cache cannot satisfy the increased demand;
Line  12 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  13 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, numLdqEntries): C: Fetch width affects instruction fetching while load queue entries handle memory operations in the execution stage - these operate at different pipeline stages and don't directly influence each other;
Line  14 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  15 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, nDCacheWays): C: Fetch width controls instruction fetching rate while data cache associativity affects data access patterns - these are independent design parameters serving different functions;
Line  16 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  17 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, decodeWidth): A: Fetch width directly determines the maximum number of instructions available for decoding, as you cannot decode more instructions than you fetch per cycle;
Line  18 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  19 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, numRCQEntries): C: Fetch width affects instruction supply while request completion queue entries handle memory request completion - these operate independently in different parts of the processor;
Line  20 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  21 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, flush): B: Pipeline flushes can reduce the effective utilization of fetch width by invalidating fetched instructions, making fetch width less effective when flushes occur frequently;
Line  22 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  23 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, intIssueWidth): A: Fetch width determines the instruction supply rate which can influence how many integer instructions are available for issue, though the relationship is indirect through the pipeline;
Line  24 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  25 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, nICacheTLBWays): C: Fetch width affects instruction demand while instruction cache TLB associativity affects address translation efficiency - these are independent architectural parameters;
Line  26 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  27 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, maxBrCount): C: Fetch width determines instruction fetching capacity while maximum branch count affects branch prediction accuracy - these are independent design parameters;
Line  28 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  29 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, numRXQEntries): C: Fetch width affects instruction supply while request crossbar queue entries handle memory system communication - these operate independently;
Line  30 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  31 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, CPI): B: CPI (cycles per instruction) is a performance metric that can influence the effectiveness of fetch width, as higher CPI reduces the demand for instruction fetching;
Line  32 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  33 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, memIssueWidth): C: Fetch width affects instruction supply while memory issue width affects memory operation dispatch - these operate at different pipeline stages independently;
Line  34 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  35 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, nICacheWays): C: Fetch width determines instruction demand while instruction cache associativity affects cache hit rates - these are independent design parameters that don't directly cause each other;
Line  36 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  37 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, numRasEntries): C: Fetch width affects instruction fetching while return address stack entries affect return instruction prediction - these are independent architectural features;
Line  38 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  39 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, enableSFBOpt): C: Fetch width is a structural parameter while store-to-load forwarding optimization is a functional feature - these are independent design choices;
Line  40 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  41 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Fetch width affects instruction fetching while data cache TLB associativity affects data address translation - these serve different functions independently;
Line  42 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  43 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, numIntPhysRegisters): C: Fetch width affects instruction supply rate while the number of integer physical registers affects register renaming capacity - these are independent architectural parameters;
Line  44 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  45 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, nL2TLBWays): C: Fetch width determines instruction fetching capacity while L2 TLB associativity affects address translation efficiency - these are independent design parameters;
Line  46 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  47 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, DCacheMiss): A: Higher fetch width can indirectly increase data cache misses by enabling more instructions to execute per cycle, potentially increasing memory access pressure;
Line  48 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  49 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, numFetchBufferEntries): A: Fetch width determines how many instructions are fetched per cycle, which directly affects the utilization and required capacity of fetch buffer entries;
Line  50 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  51 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, enablePrefetching): C: Fetch width is a structural parameter determining instruction supply while prefetching is a functional optimization technique - these are independent design features;
Line  52 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  53 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Fetch width affects instruction supply while data cache miss status holding registers handle outstanding memory requests - these operate independently;
Line  54 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  55 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, numRobEntries): A: Higher fetch width increases the instruction supply rate, which can increase the demand for reorder buffer entries to track more in-flight instructions;
Line  56 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  57 | Starts with '(': True  | (fetchWidth, fetchWidth): C: A variable cannot cause itself as this would be a logical contradiction
