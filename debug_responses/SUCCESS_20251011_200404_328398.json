    "(numFetchBufferEntries, numRXQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent buffer configurations for different processor subsystems - fetch buffers handle instruction fetching while RXQ buffers manage memory operations, with no direct causal relationship;"
    },
    "(numFetchBufferEntries, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Larger fetch buffer entries can reduce instruction fetch stalls and improve instruction throughput, directly leading to lower cycles per instruction;"
    },
    "(numFetchBufferEntries, memIssueWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Fetch buffer size and memory issue width are independent architectural parameters that can be configured separately without direct causal influence;"
