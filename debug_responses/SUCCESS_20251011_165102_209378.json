    "(maxBrCount, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Maximum branch count is a branch predictor configuration parameter that does not directly influence data cache miss behavior, as these operate in different pipeline stages with distinct functions;"
    },
    "(maxBrCount, enablePrefetching)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Maximum branch count is a branch predictor parameter while prefetching is a memory subsystem optimization technique, and these operate independently without direct causal relationship;"
    },
    "(maxBrCount, nDCacheMSHRs)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Maximum branch count affects branch prediction accuracy while the number of data cache MSHRs determines memory request handling capacity, operating in different processor subsystems without direct causation;"
