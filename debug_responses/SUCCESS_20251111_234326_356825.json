      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as it represents the same measurement;"
    },
    "(area_cell_area, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Cell area and execution time are independent design metrics that do not directly cause changes in each other;"

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These represent different physical area components in chip design that are independently determined and do not directly cause changes in each other;"
