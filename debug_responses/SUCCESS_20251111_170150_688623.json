    "(area_cell_area, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as it represents the same physical quantity measured at the same point in the design;"
    },
    "(area_cell_area, time)": {
      "result": "D",
      "explanation": "The relationship between cell area and execution time in processor design involves complex interactions through multiple intermediate factors like routing delays and critical path timing;"
    },
    "(area_cell_area, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "D",
      "explanation": "While both area metrics are related in chip design, the causal relationship between cell area and net area depends on complex design decisions and optimization trade-offs that are not definitively established;"
    }
