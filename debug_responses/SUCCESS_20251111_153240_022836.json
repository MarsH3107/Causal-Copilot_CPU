    "(power_clock, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Clock power and cell area are both outcomes of design complexity but clock power consumption does not directly determine the physical area occupied by standard cells;"
    },
    "(power_clock, area_cell_count)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Clock power consumption and the number of standard cells are both influenced by design complexity but clock power does not directly cause changes in cell count;"
    },
    "(power_clock, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Clock power and pad power are separate power consumption components in processor design that do not directly influence each other;"
    }
