    "(enablePrefetching, numRCQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Prefetching is a performance optimization technique while RCQ entries are hardware buffer resources that are typically determined during processor design phase independently;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, flush)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Enabling prefetching can increase the likelihood of pipeline flushes when mispredicted prefetches bring incorrect data into the cache hierarchy, requiring pipeline restart;"
    },
    "(enablePrefetching, nICacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Prefetching enablement is a runtime configuration while instruction cache TLB associativity is a fixed hardware design parameter determined during processor architecture design;"
    }
