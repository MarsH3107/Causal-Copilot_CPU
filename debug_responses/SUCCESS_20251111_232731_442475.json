    "(cpi, power_memory)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Both CPI and memory power consumption are outcomes of the underlying processor design parameters rather than one directly causing the other;"
    },
    "(cpi, power)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "CPI and total power consumption are both performance and efficiency metrics that result from the same underlying architectural design decisions rather than having a direct causal relationship;"
    },
    "(cpi, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "CPI and pad power consumption are independent outcomes of different aspects of processor design with no direct causal relationship between them;"
    }
