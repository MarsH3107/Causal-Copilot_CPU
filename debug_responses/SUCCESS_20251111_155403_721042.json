    "(nICacheTLBWays, power_internal)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing instruction cache TLB associativity requires additional comparators and selection logic, which directly increases internal power consumption of the TLB structure;"
    },
    "(nICacheTLBWays, area_net_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher TLB associativity necessitates more interconnect wiring between additional comparison units and selection logic, directly increasing the net area for routing;"
    },
    "(nICacheTLBWays, nDCacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The associativity of instruction cache TLB and data cache TLB are independent microarchitectural design parameters that do not causally influence each other;"
