    "(numRasEntries, numRobEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The Return Address Stack (RAS) for branch prediction and the Reorder Buffer (ROB) for out-of-order execution operate independently in different pipeline stages with no direct causal relationship;"
    },
    "(numRasEntries, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "RAS entries for return address prediction and L2 TLB entries for virtual-to-physical address translation serve completely different functions in the processor pipeline with no causal dependency;"
    },
    "(numRasEntries, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "A larger RAS improves return address prediction accuracy, reducing mispredicted returns that would otherwise cause instruction cache misses when fetching from incorrect addresses;"
