    "(fetchWidth, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing fetch width requires wider instruction fetch units and larger multiplexers, directly increasing the physical area occupied by cells in the processor design;"
    },
    "(fetchWidth, power_register)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Wider fetch width necessitates more registers to store the additional fetched instructions, directly increasing register file power consumption;"
    },
    "(fetchWidth, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Fetch width determines instruction fetch rate while L2 TLB entries are determined by memory management requirements and are independent architectural decisions;"
    }
