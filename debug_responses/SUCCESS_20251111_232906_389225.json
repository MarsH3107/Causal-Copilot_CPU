      "explanation": "Memory power consumption and cell area are independent design metrics that do not directly influence each other in processor architecture;"
    },

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These represent separate power consumption components of different processor subsystems and do not directly cause changes in each other;"

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory power consumption and the number of cells are independent design parameters that do not have a direct causal relationship;"
