    "(numFetchBufferEntries, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Fetch buffer entries are internal processor structures that do not directly affect pad power consumption, which is primarily related to I/O interface power;"
    },
    "(numFetchBufferEntries, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of fetch buffer entries directly increases switching activity as more storage elements transition states during fetch operations;"
    },
    "(numFetchBufferEntries, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of fetch buffer entries affects performance metrics like CPI but does not directly determine execution time, which depends on multiple factors;"
    }
  }
