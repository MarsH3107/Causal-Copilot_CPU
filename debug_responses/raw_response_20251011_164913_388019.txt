RAW RESPONSE:
(intIssueWidth, DCacheMiss): A: Integer issue width determines how many integer instructions can be issued per cycle, and higher issue rates increase memory access frequency, which can lead to more data cache misses when the cache cannot satisfy the increased demand;

(intIssueWidth, enablePrefetching): C: Integer issue width is a microarchitectural parameter that affects instruction throughput, while prefetching is a cache optimization technique that operates independently of the integer execution pipeline width;

(intIssueWidth, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Integer issue width affects instruction dispatch rate while the number of data cache MSHRs is a cache subsystem design parameter that handles outstanding memory requests independently of integer pipeline width;

(intIssueWidth, nL2TLBEntries): C: Integer issue width controls instruction throughput in the execution pipeline, while L2 TLB entries are a memory management unit design parameter that operates independently of integer execution width;

(intIssueWidth, ICacheMiss): A: Higher integer issue width increases the rate of instruction consumption, which can lead to more frequent instruction cache misses when the cache cannot keep up with the increased instruction fetch demand;

(intIssueWidth, numLdqEntries): C: Integer issue width affects how many integer instructions can be dispatched per cycle, while the number of load queue entries is a memory subsystem design parameter that manages outstanding load operations independently;

(intIssueWidth, nDCacheWays): C: Integer issue width determines instruction dispatch rate while the number of data cache ways is a cache organization parameter that affects cache conflict behavior independently of integer pipeline width;

(intIssueWidth, numRCQEntries): C: Integer issue width controls integer instruction throughput while the number of RCQ entries is a cache coherence mechanism parameter that operates independently of the integer execution pipeline;

(intIssueWidth, intIssueWidth): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would represent a logical impossibility;

(intIssueWidth, flush): A: Higher integer issue width can increase the penalty of pipeline flushes because more instructions are in flight and need to be discarded when a misprediction or exception occurs;

(intIssueWidth, nICacheTLBWays): C: Integer issue width affects instruction dispatch rate while instruction cache TLB ways is a memory management design parameter that operates independently of integer execution pipeline width;

(intIssueWidth, numRXQEntries): C: Integer issue width controls integer instruction throughput while RXQ entries are part of the cache coherence protocol that operates independently of the integer execution pipeline width;

(intIssueWidth, CPI): A: Integer issue width directly affects cycles per instruction because higher issue width allows more instructions to be processed per cycle, potentially reducing CPI when there is sufficient instruction-level parallelism;

(intIssueWidth, nICacheWays): C: Integer issue width determines instruction dispatch rate while the number of instruction cache ways is a cache organization parameter that affects cache conflict behavior independently of pipeline width;

(intIssueWidth, enableSFBOpt): C: Integer issue width affects instruction throughput while store-to-load forwarding optimization is a memory subsystem feature that operates independently of the integer execution pipeline width;

(intIssueWidth, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Integer issue width controls instruction dispatch rate while data cache TLB ways is a memory management unit design parameter that operates independently of integer execution pipeline width;

(intIssueWidth, nL2TLBWays): C: Integer issue width affects instruction throughput while L2 TLB ways is a memory management unit design parameter that operates independently of the integer execution pipeline width
