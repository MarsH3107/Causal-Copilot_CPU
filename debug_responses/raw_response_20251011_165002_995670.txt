RAW RESPONSE:
(nDCacheMSHRs, nDCacheMSHRs): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as it represents the same entity;

(nDCacheMSHRs, ICacheMiss): C: Data cache MSHRs handle outstanding memory requests for data cache misses and do not directly influence instruction cache miss behavior, as these are separate cache subsystems;

(nDCacheMSHRs, flush): C: The number of data cache MSHRs is a structural parameter that does not directly cause pipeline flushes, which are typically triggered by control flow changes or hazards;

(nDCacheMSHRs, CPI): A: More data cache MSHRs allow the processor to handle more outstanding memory requests concurrently, reducing memory-related stalls and improving cycles per instruction performance;

(nDCacheMSHRs, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Both are independent structural parameters of the memory hierarchy where MSHR count affects outstanding request handling while TLB ways affect address translation capacity;

(nDCacheMSHRs, DCacheMiss): A: Having more MSHRs allows the processor to overlap multiple cache misses and continue processing other instructions, effectively reducing the performance impact of individual data cache misses;
