knowledge.\n\n**Response:**\n\n(BranchPredictor, decodeWidth): C: Branch predictor accuracy and decode width are independent architectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages and do

parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline;\n\n(BranchPredictor, flush): A: Branch mispredictions directly cause pipeline flushes as the processor must discard incorrectly fetched and decoded instructions when the actual branch outcome differs from the prediction;\n\n(BranchPredictor, BranchPredictor): C: A node cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular and meaningless in causal analysis;\n\n(BranchPredictor, intIssueWidth): C: Branch predictor accuracy and integer issue width are independent architectural parameters that operate at

parameters that serve different functions in the memory hierarchy;\n\n(BranchPredictor, maxBrCount): C: Branch predictor accuracy and maximum branch count limits are independent parameters where the predictor responds to branches rather than determining their quantity;\n\n(BranchPredictor, numRXQEntries): C: Branch predictor mechanisms and the number of request queue entries are independent design parameters that operate in different subsystems of the processor;\n\n(BranchPredictor, CPI): A: Branch mispredictions directly increase cycles per instruction by causing pipeline stalls and
