    "(numLdqEntries, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of load queue entries requires more transistors and switching activity in the memory subsystem, directly increasing switching power consumption;"
    },
    "(numLdqEntries, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More load queue entries can reduce memory stalls by allowing more outstanding loads, potentially decreasing execution time through improved memory-level parallelism;"
    },
    "(numLdqEntries, cpi)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Additional load queue entries can reduce load-related stalls and improve instruction throughput, directly affecting cycles per instruction;"
