    "(power_leakage, power_leakage)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot cause itself as this would be circular reasoning and logically impossible;"
    },
    "(power_leakage, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Power leakage is determined by transistor characteristics and operating conditions, while cell area is a physical layout metric, making them independent design parameters;"
    },
    "(power_leakage, power_register)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Both are independent components of total power consumption, where leakage power comes from transistor characteristics and register power comes from switching activity;"
    }
