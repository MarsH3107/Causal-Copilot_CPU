    "(power_clock, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Clock power and cell area are both outcomes of design complexity but clock power consumption does not directly determine the physical area occupied by standard cells;"
    },
    "(power_clock, area_cell_count)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Clock power consumption and the number of standard cells are independent design metrics that both result from overall processor complexity rather than one causing the other;"
    },
    "(power_clock, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Clock power and pad power represent different power consumption components in processor design that are determined independently by their respective design parameters;"
    }
  }
