    "(nL2TLBWays, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of ways in L2 TLB requires additional hardware structures and interconnects that directly contribute to pad power consumption for signal routing;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBWays, nICacheTLBWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent design parameters for different cache structures (L2 TLB vs instruction cache TLB) that can be configured separately without direct causal relationship;"
    },
    "(nL2TLBWays, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "More ways in L2 TLB increase the switching activity during address translation operations, directly causing higher dynamic power consumption;"
    }
