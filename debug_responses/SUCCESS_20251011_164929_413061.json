    "(decodeWidth, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Decode width directly affects instruction throughput by determining how many instructions can be decoded per cycle, with wider decode stages reducing CPI by enabling higher instruction-level parallelism;"
    },
    "(decodeWidth, memIssueWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Decode width and memory issue width are independent pipeline parameters that operate at different stages, with decode width affecting instruction decoding while memory issue width affects memory operation dispatch;"
    },
    "(decodeWidth, nICacheWays)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Decode width is a pipeline parameter that affects instruction processing rate while instruction cache associativity is a memory hierarchy design choice that operates independently;"
    }
  }
