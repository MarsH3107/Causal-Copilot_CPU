    "(power_register, power_pad)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These represent independent power consumption components in different parts of the processor architecture with no direct causal relationship;"
    },
    "(power_register, time)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Register file power consumption and execution time are independent metrics that may both vary with workload but do not directly cause each other;"
    },
    "(power_register, power_clock)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These represent separate power domains in the processor with clock power being independent of register file power consumption;"
    }
