    "(numFetchBufferEntries, numRXQEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent microarchitectural parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline, with fetch buffer entries handling instruction fetching and RXQ entries managing memory operations;"
    },
    "(numFetchBufferEntries, CPI)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of fetch buffer entries can reduce instruction fetch stalls and improve instruction throughput, thereby potentially reducing cycles per instruction;"
    },
    "(numFetchBufferEntries, memIssueWidth)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "These are independent design parameters where fetch buffer size affects instruction fetching capacity while memory issue width determines memory operation parallelism;"
    }
