    "(nDCacheWays, power_pad)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing the number of data cache ways requires additional hardware structures and interconnects, which directly increases the number of I/O pads and their associated power consumption;"
    },
    "(nDCacheWays, power_switching)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Higher cache associativity requires more complex multiplexing and selection logic that switches more frequently during cache operations, directly increasing dynamic switching power consumption;"
    },
    "(nDCacheWays, time)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Increasing cache associativity adds complexity to the cache lookup and selection logic, which can increase the critical path delay and overall execution time;"
    }
  }
