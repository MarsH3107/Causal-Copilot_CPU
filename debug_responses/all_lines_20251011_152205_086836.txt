Line   1 | Starts with '(': False | Looking at each pair involving numRasEntries (Return Address Stack entries), I'll analyze the causal relationships based on computer architecture domain knowledge:
Line   2 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   3 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, numRobEntries): C: The Return Address Stack and Reorder Buffer serve different functions in the processor pipeline and their sizing decisions are independent architectural parameters;
Line   4 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   5 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, nL2TLBEntries): C: The Return Address Stack for function call prediction and L2 TLB for address translation are independent microarchitectural components with separate sizing considerations;
Line   6 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   7 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, ICacheMiss): A: A larger Return Address Stack improves function return address prediction accuracy, reducing mispredictions that can lead to instruction cache misses when fetching from incorrect addresses;
Line   8 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   9 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, numLdqEntries): C: The Return Address Stack for branch prediction and Load Queue for memory operations are independent processor components with separate design requirements;
Line  10 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  11 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, nDCacheWays): C: Return Address Stack sizing and data cache associativity are independent architectural parameters serving different processor functions;
Line  12 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  13 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, decodeWidth): C: The Return Address Stack size and instruction decode width are independent microarchitectural parameters that don't directly influence each other;
Line  14 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  15 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, numRCQEntries): C: Return Address Stack entries and Request Completion Queue entries serve different processor functions and are sized independently;
Line  16 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  17 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, flush): A: A larger Return Address Stack reduces return address mispredictions, which decreases the frequency of pipeline flushes caused by incorrect control flow predictions;
Line  18 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  19 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, intIssueWidth): C: Return Address Stack size and integer issue width are independent microarchitectural parameters serving different pipeline functions;

Line  21 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, nICacheTLBWays): C: The Return Address Stack for function return prediction and instruction cache TLB associativity are independent architectural components;
Line  22 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  23 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, maxBrCount): C: Return Address Stack size and maximum branch count are independent parameters in branch prediction and processor configuration;
Line  24 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  25 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, numRXQEntries): C: Return Address Stack entries and Request Queue entries serve different processor subsystems and are sized independently;
Line  26 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  27 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, CPI): A: A larger Return Address Stack improves return address prediction accuracy, reducing misprediction penalties and thereby decreasing cycles per instruction;
Line  28 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  29 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, memIssueWidth): C: Return Address Stack size and memory issue width are independent microarchitectural parameters serving different processor functions;
Line  30 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  31 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, nICacheWays): C: Return Address Stack sizing and instruction cache associativity are independent architectural decisions that don't directly influence each other;
Line  32 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  33 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, numRasEntries): D: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular reasoning;
Line  34 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  35 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, enableSFBOpt): C: Return Address Stack size and Store-to-Load Forwarding optimization are independent microarchitectural features serving different purposes;
Line  36 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  37 | Starts with '(': True  | (numRasEntries, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Return Address Stack entries and data cache TLB associativity are independent components serving different processor functions;
