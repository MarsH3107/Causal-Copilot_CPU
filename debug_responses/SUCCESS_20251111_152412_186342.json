    "(power_internal, power_logic)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Power_logic is a component that contributes to the total internal power consumption of a processor, as logic circuits are a fundamental part of internal power dissipation;"
    },
    "(power_internal, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "The cell area of a processor design influences internal power consumption because larger cell areas typically result in higher power dissipation due to increased capacitance and switching activity;"
    },
    "(power_internal, power_register)": {
      "result": "B",
      "explanation": "Power_register represents the power consumed by register files and contributes directly to the total internal power consumption of the processor;"
    }
  }
