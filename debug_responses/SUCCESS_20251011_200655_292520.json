    "(enableSFBOpt, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Store-to-load forwarding optimization can reduce data cache misses by allowing direct forwarding of store data to loads, bypassing cache access;"
    },
    "(enableSFBOpt, nDCacheMSHRs)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of data cache MSHRs is a static hardware configuration parameter that is not affected by enabling store-to-load forwarding optimization;"
    },
    "(enableSFBOpt, nL2TLBEntries)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "The number of L2 TLB entries is a fixed hardware configuration that is independent of store-to-load forwarding optimization settings;"
