    "(power_memory, area_cell_area)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory power consumption and physical cell area are both outcomes of design decisions but do not directly influence each other in processor architecture;"
    },
    "(power_memory, power_register)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory power consumption and register file power consumption are independent components of total processor power, each determined by their respective subsystem characteristics;"
    },
    "(power_memory, area_cell_count)": {
      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "Memory power consumption and cell count are both design parameters that result from architectural choices but do not have a direct causal relationship;"
    }
