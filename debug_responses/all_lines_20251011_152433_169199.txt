Line   1 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, CPI): A: Decode width directly affects processor performance by determining how many instructions can be decoded per cycle, with wider decode stages typically reducing CPI by enabling higher instruction throughput;
Line   2 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   3 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, memIssueWidth): C: Decode width and memory issue width are independent microarchitectural parameters that operate at different pipeline stages and do not directly influence each other;
Line   4 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   5 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, nICacheWays): C: Decode width is a pipeline parameter while instruction cache associativity is a memory hierarchy design choice, making them independent architectural decisions;
Line   6 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line   7 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, enableSFBOpt): C: Decode width affects instruction processing bandwidth while store-to-load forwarding optimization is a memory subsystem feature, making them independent design parameters;

Line  14 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  15 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, DCacheMiss): A: Decode width can indirectly influence data cache miss rates by affecting the rate at which memory-accessing instructions are processed and enter the pipeline;
Line  16 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  17 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, enablePrefetching): C: Decode width affects instruction processing bandwidth while prefetching is a memory subsystem optimization technique, making them independent design decisions;
Line  18 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  19 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, numRobEntries): C: Decode width determines front-end throughput while ROB size is a back-end resource allocation decision, though both affect overall performance independently;
Line  20 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  21 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Decode width affects instruction processing rate while data cache MSHR count is a memory subsystem resource allocation, making them independent parameters;
Line  22 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  23 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, nL2TLBEntries): C: Decode width operates in the instruction pipeline while L2 TLB capacity is a memory management unit sizing decision, making them independent;
Line  24 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  25 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, ICacheMiss): A: Decode width can influence instruction cache miss patterns by affecting the rate at which instructions are fetched and processed from the cache;
Line  26 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  27 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, numLdqEntries): C: Decode width affects front-end throughput while load queue size is a memory subsystem resource allocation, making them independent design parameters;
Line  28 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  29 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, nDCacheWays): C: Decode width determines instruction processing bandwidth while data cache associativity is a memory hierarchy design choice, making them independent;
Line  30 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  31 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, decodeWidth): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular and logically invalid;
Line  32 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  33 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, numRCQEntries): C: Decode width affects instruction processing rate while request completion queue size is a memory subsystem parameter, making them independent;
Line  34 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  35 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, flush): A: Decode width can influence pipeline flush frequency by affecting the rate at which instructions are processed and potential mispredictions are detected;
Line  36 | Starts with '(': False | 
Line  37 | Starts with '(': True  | (decodeWidth, intIssueWidth): C: Decode width and integer issue width are independent pipeline parameters that operate at different stages and are sized based on separate design considerations;
Line  38 | Starts with '(': False |
