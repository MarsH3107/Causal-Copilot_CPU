1. (numLdqEntries, CPI): A: The number of load queue entries directly affects processor performance by determining how many load operations can be tracked simultaneously, with insufficient entries causing pipeline stalls and increased cycles per instruction;
2. (numLdqEntries, nICacheWays): C: The number of load queue entries and instruction cache associativity are independent architectural parameters that operate in different parts of the processor pipeline;
3. (numLdqEntries, enableSFBOpt): C: Load queue size and store-to-load forwarding optimization are independent architectural features that don't directly influence each other's configuration;
4. (numLdqEntries, nDCacheTLBWays): C: Load queue entries and data cache TLB associativity are separate architectural parameters that operate independently in the memory subsystem;
5. (numLdqEntries, nL2TLBWays): C: The load queue size and L2 TLB associativity are independent architectural parameters that don't directly affect each other's operation;
6. (numLdqEntries, DCacheMiss): A: The number of load queue entries can influence data cache miss behavior by affecting how many outstanding memory requests can be handled, potentially impacting cache utilization patterns;
7. (numLdqEntries, enablePrefetching): C: Load queue size and prefetching enablement are independent architectural decisions that don't directly cause changes in each other;
8. (numLdqEntries, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Load queue entries and data cache miss status holding registers are separate architectural parameters that operate independently in the memory hierarchy;
9. (numLdqEntries, nL2TLBEntries): C: The number of load queue entries and L2 TLB entries are independent architectural parameters that don't directly influence each other;
10. (numLdqEntries, ICacheMiss): C: Load queue entries primarily affect data memory operations while instruction cache misses relate to instruction fetch, making them largely independent;
11. (numLdqEntries, numLdqEntries): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be circular reasoning;
12. (numLdqEntries, nDCacheWays): C: Load queue size and data cache associativity are independent architectural parameters that operate in different aspects of the memory subsystem;
13. (numLdqEntries, numRCQEntries): C: Load queue entries and request completion queue entries are separate architectural parameters that operate independently in the processor's memory subsystem;
14. (numLdqEntries, flush): A: The number of load queue entries can influence pipeline flush frequency by affecting the processor's ability to handle memory dependencies and recover from mispredictions;
15. (numLdqEntries, nICacheTLBWays): C: Load queue entries and instruction cache TLB associativity are independent architectural parameters that operate in different parts of the processor pipeline;
16. (numLdqEntries, numRXQEntries): C: Load queue entries and receive queue entries are separate architectural parameters that operate independently in the processor's communication subsystem
