    "(flush, DCacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Pipeline flushes can cause data cache misses because when the pipeline is flushed, the processor may need to re-fetch data that was previously in the cache hierarchy, potentially leading to cache misses if that data has been evicted;"
    },
    "(flush, ICacheMiss)": {
      "result": "A",
      "explanation": "Pipeline flushes directly cause instruction cache misses because when the pipeline is flushed due to branch mispredictions or exceptions, the processor must restart instruction fetching from a new address, often resulting in instruction cache misses;"
    },

      "result": "C",
      "explanation": "A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would represent a logical impossibility in causal modeling;"
