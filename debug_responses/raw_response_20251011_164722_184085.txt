RAW RESPONSE:
(numRCQEntries, nL2TLBEntries): C: The number of request completion queue entries and the number of L2 TLB entries are independent architectural parameters that serve different functions in the processor pipeline;

(numRCQEntries, ICacheMiss): C: Request completion queue entries manage memory request completion tracking while instruction cache misses are determined by cache size and access patterns, with no direct causal relationship;

(numRCQEntries, nDCacheWays): C: The number of request completion queue entries and the number of data cache ways are independent design parameters that affect different aspects of memory system performance;

(numRCQEntries, numRCQEntries): C: A variable cannot have a causal relationship with itself as this would be a tautological relationship;

(numRCQEntries, flush): C: Request completion queue entries are a static architectural parameter while pipeline flushes are dynamic events triggered by control flow changes or hazards;

(numRCQEntries, nICacheTLBWays): C: The number of request completion queue entries and instruction cache TLB ways are independent architectural parameters serving different memory subsystem functions;

(numRCQEntries, CPI): A: Increasing the number of request completion queue entries can reduce memory system stalls by allowing more outstanding requests to be tracked, potentially improving cycles per instruction;

(numRCQEntries, nICacheWays): C: Request completion queue entries and instruction cache ways are independent architectural parameters that affect different aspects of the memory hierarchy;

(numRCQEntries, nDCacheTLBWays): C: The number of request completion queue entries and data cache TLB ways are independent design parameters serving different memory subsystem functions;

(numRCQEntries, nL2TLBWays): C: Request completion queue entries and L2 TLB ways are independent architectural parameters that serve different functions in the memory hierarchy;

(numRCQEntries, DCacheMiss): C: Request completion queue entries manage completion tracking while data cache misses depend on cache configuration and access patterns, with no direct causal relationship;

(numRCQEntries, nDCacheMSHRs): C: Request completion queue entries and data cache MSHRs are independent architectural parameters that serve different functions in the memory subsystem
