Use PC algorithm for causal discovery. CAUSAL STRUCTURE DEFINITION FOR CPU DESIGN SPACE EXPLORATION

=== THREE-TIER HIERARCHICAL CONSTRAINT ===

TIER 0 - Exogenous Microarchitectural Parameters (22 variables)
BranchPredictor, fetchWidth, numFetchBufferEntries, numRasEntries, maxBrCount, decodeWidth, numRobEntries, numIntPhysRegisters, memIssueWidth, intIssueWidth, numLdqEntries, enablePrefetching, enableSFBOpt, numRXQEntries, numRCQEntries, nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBWays, nICacheWays, nICacheTLBWays, nDCacheWays, nDCacheMSHRs, nDCacheTLBWays.

These are design-time configurable parameters. They act ONLY as causes (parent nodes), NEVER as effects. They have NO causal relationships among themselves.

TIER 1 - Endogenous Intermediate Mechanisms (11 variables)
power_leakage, power_internal, power_switching, power_memory, power_register, power_logic, power_clock, power_pad, area_cell_count, area_cell_area, area_net_area.

These are independent measurement metrics. CRITICAL - They are INDEPENDENTLY measured components that do NOT cause each other. Each is directly determined by Tier 0 parameters. They have NO causal relationships among themselves. They only aggregate into Tier 2 final metrics.

TIER 2 - Final Performance Metrics (4 variables)
cpi, power, area, time.

These are aggregated outcomes that act ONLY as effects (leaf nodes), NEVER as causes. They are computed by summing or aggregating Tier 1 components.

=== CRITICAL CAUSAL CONSTRAINTS ===

1. FORBIDDEN DIRECTIONS (prevent reverse causality)
   - Tier 1 to Tier 0 - Intermediate metrics CANNOT cause design parameters
   - Tier 2 to Tier 0 - Performance metrics CANNOT cause design parameters
   - Tier 2 to Tier 1 - Performance metrics CANNOT cause intermediate metrics

2. FORBIDDEN WITHIN-TIER (prevent spurious correlations)
   - No edges between ANY Tier 0 variables (parameters are independently configured)
   - No edges between ANY Tier 1 variables (they are independently measured components - power_register cannot cause power_clock, area_cell_count cannot cause area_net_area, etc.)
   - No edges between ANY Tier 2 variables (outcomes are independent metrics)

3. REQUIRED DIRECTIONS (enforce physical causality)
   - Tier 0 to Tier 1 - Design parameters MUST influence intermediate components
   - Tier 1 to Tier 2 - Intermediate components MUST aggregate into final metrics
   - Specifically, power components (power_*) should aggregate into power metric
   - Specifically, area components (area_*) should aggregate into area metric

4. DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE
   - Power is the sum of power_leakage, power_internal, power_switching, power_memory, power_register, power_logic, power_clock, power_pad
   - Area is the sum of area_cell_area and area_net_area (area_cell_count is a count metric)
   - CPI and time are performance metrics determined by microarchitectural behaviors

=== OBJECTIVE ===
Discover ONLY the causal pathways from Tier 0 (design parameters) directly to Tier 1 (independent components) directly to Tier 2 (aggregated outcomes). The structure must be strictly hierarchical with no edges within any tier.
