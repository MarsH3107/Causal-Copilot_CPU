User original query (TOP PRIORITY):
Use PC algorithm for causal discovery. CAUSAL STRUCTURE DEFINITION FOR CPU DESIGN SPACE EXPLORATION

=== THREE-TIER HIERARCHICAL CONSTRAINT ===

TIER 0 - Exogenous Microarchitectural Parameters (22 variables)
BranchPredictor, fetchWidth, numFetchBufferEntries, numRasEntries, maxBrCount, decodeWidth, numRobEntries, numIntPhysRegisters, memIssueWidth, intIssueWidth, numLdqEntries, enablePrefetching, enableSFBOpt, numRXQEntries, numRCQEntries, nL2TLBEntries, nL2TLBWays, nICacheWays, nICacheTLBWays, nDCacheWays, nDCacheMSHRs, nDCacheTLBWays.

These are design-time configurable parameters. They act ONLY as causes (parent nodes), NEVER as effects. They have NO causal relationships among themselves.

TIER 1 - Endogenous Intermediate Mechanisms (11 variables)
power_leakage, power_internal, power_switching, power_memory, power_register, power_logic, power_clock, power_pad, area_cell_count, area_cell_area, area_net_area.

These are independent measurement metrics. CRITICAL - They are INDEPENDENTLY measured components that do NOT cause each other. Each is directly determined by Tier 0 parameters. They have NO causal relationships among themselves. They only aggregate into Tier 2 final metrics.

TIER 2 - Final Performance Metrics (4 variables)
cpi, power, area, time.

These are aggregated outcomes that act ONLY as effects (leaf nodes), NEVER as causes. They are computed by summing or aggregating Tier 1 components.

=== CRITICAL CAUSAL CONSTRAINTS ===

1. FORBIDDEN DIRECTIONS (prevent reverse causality)
   - Tier 1 to Tier 0 - Intermediate metrics CANNOT cause design parameters
   - Tier 2 to Tier 0 - Performance metrics CANNOT cause design parameters
   - Tier 2 to Tier 1 - Performance metrics CANNOT cause intermediate metrics

2. FORBIDDEN WITHIN-TIER (prevent spurious correlations)
   - No edges between ANY Tier 0 variables (parameters are independently configured)
   - No edges between ANY Tier 1 variables (they are independently measured components - power_register cannot cause power_clock, area_cell_count cannot cause area_net_area, etc.)
   - No edges between ANY Tier 2 variables (outcomes are independent metrics)

3. REQUIRED DIRECTIONS (enforce physical causality)
   - Tier 0 to Tier 1 - Design parameters MUST influence intermediate components
   - Tier 1 to Tier 2 - Intermediate components MUST aggregate into final metrics
   - Specifically, power components (power_*) should aggregate into power metric
   - Specifically, area components (area_*) should aggregate into area metric

4. DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE
   - Power is the sum of power_leakage, power_internal, power_switching, power_memory, power_register, power_logic, power_clock, power_pad
   - Area is the sum of area_cell_area and area_net_area (area_cell_count is a count metric)
   - CPI and time are performance metrics determined by microarchitectural behaviors

=== OBJECTIVE ===
Discover ONLY the causal pathways from Tier 0 (design parameters) directly to Tier 1 (independent components) directly to Tier 2 (aggregated outcomes). The structure must be strictly hierarchical with no edges within any tier.

The computation has to be finished in the runtime of 1440.0 minutes.

## ⚠️ ESSENTIAL QUERY PRIORITY ⚠️
- User query SUPERSEDES all standard hyperparameter guidelines
- Extract specific needs, constraints, domain insights from user query FIRST
- Parameters MUST be adjusted to meet user's explicit requirements 
- ALL recommendations MUST directly align with the user's stated objectives
- User domain knowledge overrides general optimization guidelines

## 🎯 DOMAIN EXPERTISE EXTRACTION 🎯
**CRITICAL FOR ALGORITHM THAT SUPPORT DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE INJECTION**: Actively analyze the user query and background knowledge for explicit or implicit causal constraints that can be formalized as:
- **Forbidden edges**: "X cannot cause Y", "A does not influence B", "remove connection between..."
- **Required edges**: "X must cause Y", "A should influence B", "ensure connection between..."  
- **Temporal constraints**: "A happens before B", "X precedes Y in time"

When such domain expertise is identified, PRIORITIZE configuring the background_knowledge or link_assumptions parameters to incorporate this valuable prior information.

**Summary:** This is a computer architecture design space exploration dataset where configuration parameters causally determine performance, power, and area metrics through complex, primarily nonlinear relationships governed by fundamental computer architecture principles.

We have selected the following algorithm for causal discovery:

Algorithm: PC

Now, we need to determine the optimal hyperparameters for this algorithm. I'll guide you through a systematic approach to select values that prioritize accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency for moderate graph sizes.

Primary hyperparameters to configure: alpha, indep_test, depth

For each hyperparameter, please follow this structured approach:

Step 1: Understand the dataset characteristics
   - Consider the number of variables (graph size)
   - Analyze sample size and data distribution
   - Note if data is linear/nonlinear, continuous/discrete/mixed
   - For time-series data, prioritize the statistically estimated lag order

Step 2: Assess computational resources
   - Consider the hardware constraints and GPU availability:
   
Current machine doesn't support CUDA, do not choose any GPU-powered algorithms.

   - Prioritize to GPU implemented hyperparameter when dealing with large graph (variable size > 150) to achieve more efficient speedup

Step 3: Evaluate each hyperparameter's impact on accuracy vs. efficiency
   - Critical parameters affecting accuracy (e.g., significance levels, independence tests)
   - Parameters affecting computational complexity (e.g., search depth, maximum conditions)
   - Parameters controlling sparsity (e.g., regularization, thresholds)

Step 4: Analyze algorithm-specific recommendations
   - Review expert suggestions for each parameter:
   "**Parameter:** alpha\n- **Meaning:** Desired significance level in (0, 1)\n- **Available Values:**\n  - 0.05\n  - 0.1\n  - 0.01\n- **Expert Suggestion:** Use 0.05 as default. Adjust based on sample size, more conservative (lower) values for larger samples. If < 500, use 0.1; Else if 500-10000 (<10000 but >500), use 0.05; Else if > 10000, using 0.01.\n\n**Parameter:** indep_test\n- **Meaning:** Independence test method\n- **Available Values:**\n  - fisherz_cpu\n  - fisherz_gpu\n  - chisq_cpu\n  - chisq_gpu\n  - kci_cpu\n  - cmiknn_gpu\n  - fastkci_cpu\n  - rcit_cpu\n- **Expert Suggestion:** Use fisherz_cpu as default (for linear data). Choose based on data type and hardware. DON'T use nonlinear/non-parametric tests for linear/discrete data.\n\nLINEAR/DISCRETE (PARAMETRIC) TESTS:\n- 'fisherz_cpu': For linear continuous data (default choice for linear data)\n- 'fisherz_gpu': GPU version for linear continuous data (only if variable size > 150 and sample size > 7500)\n- 'chisq_cpu': For discrete data only\n- 'chisq_gpu': GPU version for discrete data (only if variable size > 150 and sample size > 7500)\n\nNONLINEAR/NON-PARAMETRIC TESTS:\n- 'kci_cpu': For nonlinear data (very slow, ONLY use if variable size < 10 and sample size < 1500)\n- 'rcit_cpu': Fastest approximation of kci (use only if variable size < 100 and sample size < 10000)\n- 'fastkci_cpu': Divide-and-conquer version of kci, faster than kci but less accurate (use only if variable size < 20 and sample size < 3000)\n- 'cmiknn_gpu': GPU accelerated nonlinear test (use only if data is nonlinear, and variable size > 50 or sample size > 3000)\n\nFor nonlinear data, as long as variable and sample size constraints are fulfilled, choose in order of accuracy: KCI > RCIT > FastKCI >= CMiKNN. For smaller datasets, use CPU tests for better accuracy even if GPU is available. You MUST use GPU tests for large datasets (variable size > 150) if GPU is available.\n\n**Parameter:** depth\n- **Meaning:** Maximum depth for skeleton search\n- **Available Values:**\n  - -1\n  - 6\n  - 5\n  - 4\n  - 3\n- **Expert Suggestion:** Use -1 as default. Use -1 for unlimited depth. For large graphs, limiting depth (e.g., 2-4) can significantly speed up the algorithm with a minor trade-off in accuracy. For CPU-based independence tests: A graph with node number < 10, use depth 6; A graph with node number 10-25, use depth 5; A graph with node number 25-50, use depth 4; A graph with node number > 50, use depth 3. For GPU-accelerated independence tests: A graph with node number < 50, use depth -1; A graph with node number 50-100, use depth 5; A graph with node number > 100, use depth 4.\n\n**Parameter:** background_knowledge\n- **Meaning:** Domain expertise constraints on causal structure\n- **Available Values:**\n  - None\n- **Expert Suggestion:** Use null as default when no domain knowledge is available. When user provides explicit causal constraints, the LLM will automatically format them as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n**FORBIDDEN EDGES**: When user specifies edges that should NOT exist\n- Format: {\"forbidden_edges\": [[\"var1\", \"var2\"], [\"var3\", \"var4\"]]}\n- Example: User says 'Temperature cannot cause Age' \u2192 {\"forbidden_edges\": [[\"Temperature\", \"Age\"]]}\n\n**REQUIRED EDGES**: When user specifies edges that MUST exist  \n- Format: {\"required_edges\": [[\"var1\", \"var2\"], [\"var3\", \"var4\"]]}\n- Example: User says 'Education must influence Income' \u2192 {\"required_edges\": [[\"Education\", \"Income\"]]}\n\n**TIER CONSTRAINTS**: When user specifies variable ordering/hierarchy\n- Format: {\"tiers\": {\"var1\": 0, \"var2\": 1, \"var3\": 1, \"var4\": 2}}\n- Example: User says 'Demographics \u2192 Behaviors \u2192 Outcomes' \u2192 {\"tiers\": {\"Age\": 0, \"Education\": 0, \"Exercise\": 1, \"Diet\": 1, \"Health\": 2}}\n\n**MIXED CONSTRAINTS**: Combine multiple constraint types when user provides complex domain knowledge\n- Format: {\"forbidden_edges\": [...], \"required_edges\": [...], \"tiers\": {...}}\n\nIMPORTANT: Only use when domain constraints are explicitly or clearly implied in user query. Improper constraints can hurt performance. The LLM should extract constraint information from user input and format it as a structured JSON object.\n\n"

Step 5: Analyze algorithm performance with different hyperparameter configurations (If existed)
   - Review benchmarking results for this algorithm with various hyperparameter settings
   - Identify which configurations perform best on datasets with similar characteristics
   - Consider how different hyperparameter values affect performance metrics
   - Analyze the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency

Step 6: Make final decisions based on:
   - For moderate graph sizes (<50 variables), prioritize accuracy over speed
   - For large graphs (>50 variables), balance accuracy with feasibility and EFFICIENCY
   - For time-series data, carefully consider temporal parameters

Please provide your suggestions in a structured JSON format, with detailed reasoning for each hyperparameter. Your response should look like this:

{
  "algorithm": "PC",
  "hyperparameters": {
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_FULL_NAME]",
      "reasoning": "[YOUR_STEP_BY_STEP_REASONING_PROCESS]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION_OF_TRADEOFFS]"
    },
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_FULL_NAME]",
      "reasoning": "[YOUR_STEP_BY_STEP_REASONING_PROCESS]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION_OF_TRADEOFFS]"
    }
  }
}

Important guidelines:
1. Only select values from the "available_values" list for each hyperparameter
2. For moderate graph sizes (10-50 variables), prioritize accuracy over speed
3. For time-series data, give special attention to lag parameters based on statistical estimates
4. For time-series data of moderate size (10-50) variables, if the estimated time lag is small (1 or 2), consider using a larger value
5. Consider independence test selection carefully based on data type and computational resources
6. For regularization parameters, consider the expected graph density
7. For search depth parameters, consider the complexity of potential causal relationships

Please provide your hyperparameter suggestions following this JSON structure, with clear reasoning that demonstrates you've considered the dataset characteristics, algorithm requirements, and computational constraints.
